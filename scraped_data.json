DAOs are, however, institutions. They are organizations of people who come together to do something collectively that no one person could do on their own.

And through an ease of customization, each person can use the version of the apps that they prefer, editing and augmenting as needed to create their ideal digital environment.

Broader ecological questions would also come into play, as would divisions of power and governance in subject specific matters based, for instance, on Indigenous groups’ ancestral claim to the land and its management. A DAO used for this purpose might need stricter membranes and governance systems; the DAO might also need to develop new ways of accounting, utilizing unique, shifting metrics for understanding water use. Clarity and consent as well as the evolvability of the community’s rules and organization enable all of this, from the development of metacurrencies to contextual distributions of power based not on token ownership but rather deeper social relationships and connections to particular issues.",

While our watershed DAO might have more issues forking because of the relationships to power in meatspace, it can still evolve over time, for instance to account for new ways of measuring the ecological impact of a dam. The DAO does not have to bind itself to one currency or system of value because SACs maintain integrity even as they shift their protocols and methods of accounting."

All in all things have gone quite well for such a cutting edge project. The biggest challenge in the Holochain universe is figuring out what bugs are coming from my code and what might be coming from Holochain itself or from the experimental Shipyard code, and keeping up with the many moving pieces.

One, Kwaxala, is building financial tools for investing in the environments we want to preserve; and the other, IOEN (the Internet of Energy Network), is connecting global finance to the local renewables that need to be developed. Together, they represent the beginning of a movement for ethical investment and regenerative economics.",

            "Renewable energy is the future. If our civilization has a future, we will have to shift to more sustainable methods for meeting our energy needs. That much is clear. It’s also clear that fossil fuel companies are resistant to this change, and that large solar and wind farms can only be one part of the solution. Small scale local energy production will be a large portion of the global market. Minigrids and Microgrids are emerging as solutions that are more efficient and resilient as they don’t need the massive infrastructure of energy distribution on top of the infrastructure of production. Energy is generated, stored, traded, and used locally.",
            "The pathway to fully clean, tradable energy is not immediate. On the way to full access to clean energy, organizations including large corporations are taking seriously the responsibility to offset their production of carbon emissions. A factory produces a lot of carbon, both from the energy it uses and the industrial processes themselves. They can get their electricity from renewable sources, but depending on where a particular factory is and when they are operating, they might not have access to renewables. Renewable energy generation is subject to location, geography, and access to resources like wind, enough sunshine, and the ability to store electricity.",
            "What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?",
            "But, just because they are incapable of directly using renewable energy doesn’t mean that they cannot support the use of renewables generally. Environmental Attribute Credits (EACs), including carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), help create incentives to invest, support, and use renewable energy.",
            "Currently, large renewable energy farms can sell carbon credits or RECs (depending on the system used), helping corporations offset their carbon emissions. But these are economies of scale. The accounting needed to get government issuance of these carbon credits only works at large scales (a single electrical meter is a lot easier to measure and monitor than many distributed meters).",
            "IOEN is providing a way for small scale energy producers who serve their local communities to aggregate their energy production and access global renewable certificate markets.",
            "In order to ensure auditability and to account for distributed energy production by a collection of small holders, data is needed to track energy production. IOEN’s current work with partners in Asia is helping companies and home owners provide two types of data. First, photos of their solar arrays, preferably at the time of installation. Secondly, ongoing readings from their meter, showing the energy that they feed back to their local grid. IOEN’s partners then add satellite data which is used to confirm the installation of solar panels at the sites claimed. All of this data becomes available to regulators who can cross reference each source, ensuring that the meter readings match the expected generation range for the panels.",
            "Aggregating the data of many individual producers allows IOEN to meet the scale requirements to work with government regulators, procuring and then selling the certificates to corporations. As each individual energy producer’s contributions to this larger pool is tracked, they are able to then be compensated directly in relation to the amount of energy they produced.",
            "Key to IOEN’s value in the market is the ability for clients to store the data (meter data, photographs etc.) in private networks hosted on Holochain which provides auditors with assurance that the certificates minted are validated and true. This creates transparency and integrity in the certificate. IOEN’s blockchain solutions that sit on top of that data then allow secondary markets to emerge, along with fractionalised investment opportunities in these renewable assets, creating liquidity. Because transactions are all tracked on the blockchain, and linked to secure data in Holochain, different organizations involved in the assets all can be paid seamlessly and transparently through fractionalised payments. Already small businesses, communities, and large corporations are seeing the value in this approach for a number of energy-related environmental assets."

And the question is: how can we invest in that value? Kwaxala is making that a possibility. Most land used for logging, oil drilling and fracking, and other resource extraction is government owned and often in contradiction with recognised Indigenous land rights in the area. Companies own or buy the permits and right to extract resources from that land, without buying the land itself.",

This enables them to command a premium market price per tonne. Additionally, by enabling capital investment directly into the organization holding the right to regenerate, they provide a new way for investment funds to flow into the asset value of the protected natural ecosystem, generating much needed upfront capital to establish these protected areas and counterbalance the extractive economic pressure to destroy the area.",
            "But how do we ensure that the land is well taken care of? Here Kwaxala is using overlapping datasets to build a picture of the ecosystem and its health. Working with Indigenous land stewards, who are also the principal shareholders in Kwaxala itself, they are developing the metrics needed to monitor and support the wellbeing of the particular ecosystems. For some situations, that might be the water and air quality; for others, it might be the presence of indicator species; for many,",

Building on Holochain in this case ensures that control of the data isn’t managed solely by the organization claiming to be protecting the ecosystem, but is rather distributed between all stakeholders. With data provenance baked in, it is also easy to track exactly what agent adds any particular piece of data. This combination of verification and distributed storage of overlapping datasets allows for a high degree of trust to be developed, and holds the organization itself accountable.",

            "But Professor McCarthy says this old way of accounting doesn't work well anymore. It doesn't show the whole story of what's really happening in the economy. When something happens, like when two companies trade goods, traditional accounting quickly turns it into simple numbers and accounts, stripping away the context and rich data of the transaction. It doesn't keep all the important details.",
            "This makes it hard for companies to understand their supply chains and how their actions impact the environment. The old accounting method is like telling a story but leaving out key parts. And Professor McCarthy thinks it’s time for change."

            "In REA, instead of just writing down numbers, accountants keep track of all the important stuff. They look at the resources being traded, the events happening, and the people or companies involved. It's like writing a detailed story that doesn't leave anything out. \"I found a new way of [telling economic stories] using Entity Relationship modeling, and later other things, that was called R E A, because “R” means the two resources that they were going to swap; “A” means to two agents who are at arm's length with each other; and “E” very simply means the process of sending things across this way.\" Professor McCarthy explains.",
            "With REA, it's easier to see how things are connected. For example, if a company sells something, REA would keep track of what was sold, who bought it, and how it affects things like inventory and contracts. This gives a clearer picture of the economy. Imagine a visual story… \"You have a customer called Charlie who will make a sale of inventory. And we put an object into the system, and it's described as a sale or shipment,\" Professor McCarthy elaborates.",

People want detailed information about the origin and processing of the products they buy, from the farming and dyeing of cotton to the processing of olive oil. They want assurances about the absence of certain chemicals in the soil and the testing done at various stages of production.",
            "It’s this demand for transparency driven by a growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts of business that has customers shifting to companies which are optimizing for sustainability rather than profit.",
            "In response to these concerns, we are seeing changes in regulations, particularly in the EU and North America, that require companies to provide more detailed information about their supply chains. REA accounting is well-suited to meet these requirements because it allows for the flow of contextualized data, not just numbers on ledgers.",
            "However, changing accounting systems is not easy. \"The biggest barrier to all of my work for years has been computational viability,\" Professor McCarthy admits.

They tend to be diverse, and there’s a diversity of forms that allows it to adapt to complex, changing environments. And evolution in that, I think, is learning about information and feedback loops.”",

            "As Pete Corke explains, \"Living nature isn't represented in [our economy]. It's all dead and extracted from nature. And in fact, the only way of creating value-flows from the current system into protected nature is by literally burning the transactional medium, burning money through philanthropy.\"",
            "In other words, the current economic system only recognizes the value of nature when it is extracted and sold, and the only way to direct money towards conservation is through philanthropic donations, which do not generate any economic returns or retain asset value.",
            "This approach has led to a lack of ways to recognize the value of ecosystems and the services they provide. Remote communities, like those in British Columbia, Canada, face a tough choice between participating in the resource extraction that makes up most of the local economy or supporting conservation efforts that often lack economic incentives.",
            "Additionally, the established laws and structures around land use are deeply rooted in this resource-focused economic system, making it difficult to create change. So how can one aim to operate within the current structure and transform the economics?",

Specifically, regenerative economics would be creating incentive-based conservation efforts that spur economic growth while protecting nature.",
            "As Pete Corke explains, \"The whole point of the regenerative economics space is, hey, we need a two polled [economic] world here to create a counterbalance.\"",
            "One key opportunity lies in generating value flows to conserve natural areas and the local communities that support these ecosystems. Pete emphasizes the importance of creating \"an economic activity that's based on regeneration [which] counteracts extractive economic value.\"",
            "is building a global network of protected forest areas that, at scale, generate economic markets for natural systems. Their projects demonstrate on-going returns for both forest communities and mindful investors.",
            "Most resource extraction happens on public lands, with companies buying the rights (to log, mine, or drill for oil) that give them use of that land. By buying these rights and safeguarding them, managing the land appropriately, and documenting the revitalization of these ecosystems, it’s possible to demonstrate the value of conservation in a global market.",

They clean the air and water, offer mental health benefits to individuals, provide educational opportunities and recreational spaces for children, and attract tourism to communities.",

One market tool is high quality carbon credits, which can be produced through the act of conservation to start accounting for these benefits.",
            "By developing mechanisms that allow individuals and businesses to invest in and hold value in living natural assets, regenerative economics can provide a viable alternative to extractive industries. Whilst carbon offsets and biodiversity credits represent an economic mechanism for recognising the services provided by nature, there are very few mechanisms that enable you to hold equity/investment value in the supply side of that value flow. But that is changing and Kwaxala is leading in that space."

            "Ultimately, the success of regenerative economics hinges on shifting mindsets and creating a new paradigm that recognizes the inherent value of nature. As Pete states, \"Nature doesn't just need a seat at the economic table, we need to acknowledge that it is the table and it's also the air in the room! The human economic system is a subsidiary of the natural economic system.\"",
            "As the world faces mounting environmental challenges, the need for a regenerative economic system has never been more pressing. Pete Corke and Kwaxala's work in partnering with Indigenous communities, protecting at-risk forests, and generating regenerative returns through innovative financial mechanisms that allow anybody to hold equity value in a living forest serves as a powerful example of how we can begin to create a true counterbalance to the extractive economy.",
            "By leveraging Web3 tools such as Holochain, regenerative projects can create a trustworthy data layer that ensures transparency and trust in regenerative economic systems. Holochain's architecture allows for the distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data, essential for documenting ecosystem interactions and ensuring the integrity of regenerative assets.",

These examples highlight the need for trustable solutions that provide transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof records of regenerative assets and their associated impacts. Holochain's distributed data layer creates a system resistant to manipulation and greenwashing, ensuring the value generated by regenerative economics is genuine and long-lasting.",

Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.",
            "The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.",
            "And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast.",

Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.",

There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote.

Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain.

Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.",

We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.",

People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.",

The solution involves creating a unique ID for each NFT that combines the content and your wallet address (ID = hash(content + wallet)). This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID.

The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a \"game steward\" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result? All players of the game will receive a percentage of the sale of any NFT minted during the game."

It comes preinstalled in the Launcher and powers both the App Store feature and the DevHub UI. And in the future it will be integrated into the Holo suite to allow ‘hApp managers’ — either developers or people forking a hApp for their group’s personal use — to get their hApps onto HoloPorts.",

Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.",

            "The problem gets worse as you try to make blockchain do more things, which has been its aspiration, more or less, since Ethereum positioned itself as a decentralized world computer when it launched in 2014. That’s the point at which blockchains began to be able to store not just transaction records but all kinds of files and even executable application code that performs functions when accessed, resulting in new data that also gets written to the blockchain. It’s been an attractive idea to imagine that much of what we do on the web today could be hosted on blockchain networks as decentralized applications (dApps). In reality, though, apps like social networks, communication platforms, travel-booking systems, ride-sharing systems, calendar systems, and so on need much faster throughput, by many orders of magnitude, than blockchain can provide. Can you imagine waiting several minutes (and paying a gas fee!) to get a message through on a chat platform? Or for an edit to show up on a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs? Can you imagine how much computation and storage would be required to accommodate on a blockchain all of the photos and videos on social media, with all nodes needing to write all of that data and keep it forever?

Some of them focus on ‘layer-1’ solutions, which attempt to increase the throughput of blockchain protocols themselves, while others are ‘layer-2’, which perform computations or store data off-chain and then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Most of these solutions, though, seem to be setting their sights on low-throughput applications such as financial transacting as opposed to live collaboration apps, social networks, media platforms, and so on. And the few that do seem capable of handling a broader set of applications make compromises on decentralization, concentrating hosting and consensus mechanisms among centrally authorized nodes.",

It’s more resilient to corruption than any ledgering or value-storage system than has ever existed before, and it is changing global finance as a result, with lots of room for growth still.

The cells already embody the changes: the levels of oxygen in the blood cells, for example, determine whether they offer oxygen to organ tissue cells in exchange for carbon dioxide.

But as we started using the web for mass-scale, real-time interaction, it became important. We needed to make sure we were all speaking the same ‘tasks and meeting invites’ language as our colleagues, the same ‘posts and likes’ language as our friends and relatives, the same ‘money transfers’ language as the stores we shopped at.",

But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.",

For these application protocols, we’ll soon be adding the ability for users to automatically download and activate an update — no manual steps needed.",
            "Additionally, in contrast to Web2, where everyone is forced into the same experience, a Holochain application can give groups a choice about whether to accept protocol changes, while also being able to keep all their existing data. For instance, if a chat app releases an upgrade, one team in a company can upgrade because they want the new features, while another team in the same company can stay on the old version because they prefer the UI. They run the app; it’s their choice."

For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.",

But therein lay the rub: Holochain is not yet cell phone ready. So, to do this, we would actually need to either get it ready for phones, or come up with a work-around that was more like Holo-hosting, where cell phone users could just use a browser to access a Holochain instance through a proxy. But of course we couldn’t use actual Holo-hosting itself because this was all supposed to work on a day where access to the wider internet was off!",

As a backup, in case we couldn’t get plan A to work in time (we only had a few months), we would also develop a multiplexer, a kind of “Holo-hosting-light,” that would allow browser access to a pool of Holochain conductors that we would run on a cluster of small boxes on-site.",

            "For a number of complex reasons, we realized about six weeks before the event that Plan A for mobile wasn’t going to land in time for DWeb. There were too many development steps with too much risk to be able to be sure it would work. Though we had the conductor compiling and working on iOS and Android, some aspects of networking were being blocked, and we realized that there just wasn’t enough time to test, debug, and get the app through the Apple/Google App/Play-Store deployment process. So we switched completely to Plan B which appeared to be working very well. I was able to build the multiplexer in a weekend, which was what we expected because it's a fairly low complexity solution. It’s just a simple Node web app sitting behind a reverse-proxy which does 3 things: 1) installs app instances using people’s keys and passwords as a seed for generating their key-pair, 2) creates a UI credential that gets stored in people’s browser as a cookie, and 3) accepts zome calls from the UI signed using that credential and forwards it to the appropriate conductor.",
            "But then things started to get hairy: as we ran our testing sessions with more and more people, we started to get zome-call timeouts and other symptoms that looked like conductor overload. This was quite surprising as it was happening at levels of interaction well below those we subjected the conductor to in our initial smoke-testing. We soon discovered that this was because users were often just reloading their web-browsers which was dropping in-progress websocket connections to the conductor. Holochain was designed under the assumption of a single user connecting over a few websockets to a local conductor, here we were creating hundreds of unexpected websocket connections. To fix this, we added web-socket connection multiplexing into our multiplexer setup! This improved things, but still, after a while, things stopped working again.",
            "Grrrr.",
            "So then, as we continued to debug these issues, we really started seeing the rise of additional contextual complexity.",
            "Example: our plan for deploying to our cluster using our internal nix infrastructure (based on hydra), was implemented, but incomplete because we discovered that we wouldn’t be able to serve our multiplexer service over plain http because cell phone browsers get grumpy about that and basically require https for decent user experience. So we had to include adding and provisioning ssl certificates to reverse-proxy web-servers. And well, it just snowballed from there…"

So, there we are with the whole cluster provisioned and hundreds of people starting to use the app when suddenly the power went out to the whole valley.

This feeling grew stronger over time, and at times, I wondered if my enthusiasm for Holochain might be an exaggeration due to my deep involvement. As a non-technical person, I was concerned that I might have missed something important about it. That is why I wanted to see how others, especially technical experts and policy makers, perceived Holochain when they were learning about its “whys, hows, and whats” at the camp.",
            "It proved to be a bit challenging for them to grasp Holochain because it has a completely different paradigm compared to blockchain. While blockchain is data-centric, Holochain is agent-centric. This means that the users, which include ourselves and our devices, play a central role in a Holochain network. This perspective shift is difficult because it requires adapting to a more distributed and truly peer-to-peer way of managing data and interactions between autonomous agents. Additionally, understanding other aspects of Holo and Holochain such as the mechanism behind HoloFuel, a mutual-credit system backed by hosting power which is a significantly different approach from fiat or Ethereum for example, added another layer of complexity. However, as they started to understand it, I clearly observed the excitement in their eyes.",
            "They became excited because they could envision how this tool/framework enables us to address and solve problems effectively. Therefore, this excitement among technical persons and policy makers was not merely a result of theoretical fascination, but rather a recognition of the practical possibilities and potential solutions that Holochain brings to the table. It sparked a genuine excitement about the transformative impact it could have on our digital sphere and the abilities it offers to individuals and communities in shaping their own destinies.",

Despite creating or being involved in an exceptional and potentially disruptive technology framework, the team members and the community exhibited true modesty. This humility was not artificial or some sort of facade; it is an inherent part of their nature, and it likely contributed to their ability to develop Holochain. Inspired by nature, they clearly combine their intelligence with the virtue of humility. They are not driven by a desire to save the world; instead, they passionately work towards building a meaningful tool that can assist people in their daily lives. And quite possibly, their dedicated efforts will ultimately lead to world-changing improvements.",

Veri merkezli bakış açısından bu bakış açısına geçmek zordur çünkü kendi iradeleriyle hareket eden katılımcılar arasındaki veri ve etkileşimleri yönetmenin daha dağıtık ve gerçek anlamda eşler arasında (P2P) işleyen bir yöntemine uyum sağlamayı gerektirir. Ayrıca, Holo ve Holochain'in, örneğin fiat paralardan ve Ethereum'dan önemli ölçüde farklı bir yaklaşıma sahip olması, barındırma gücüyle desteklenen bir karşılıklı kredi (mutual-credit) sistemi olan HoloFuel'in arkasındaki mekanizma gibi diğer yönlerini anlamak, başka bir karmaşıklık katmanı ekler.

Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.",
            "IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.",
            "For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).",
            "IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.",

            "For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.",
            "Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy."

This is a simple fact of physics. In the client–server paradigm this isn’t even a problem, because we start from a centralized server where there is a canonical notion of what the data is and a canonical time. The central server stores the data reality. The brilliance of blockchain is that it provides a protocol for distributed peers to hold data reality together, be it the order of transaction of Bitcoins, or the ordering of computation steps on Ethereum. But it does this by enforcing a single ordering of events. The stupidity of blockchain is that the protocol it uses to enforce this single ordering of events is incredibly expensive, extremely wasteful of computation power, and generates obscene amounts of greenhouse gases. On top of all that, for almost all distributed collaborative applications it's not even necessary to keep one single global ordering of events. It’s easy to make this mistake of thinking so if your purpose is a trustless system that’s trying to track the location of digital coins, but it turns out that you can still solve that same problem a different way.",

Subversion was based on the mental model of a centralized repository (a database of changes to the code’s text files) from which coders would 1) make local check-outs of that source code 2) edit the files, 3) and then make a commit (which is storing back into the database a set of such changes), but 4) you might have to merge your changes before you could make the commit if someone else had committed first, which entailed resolving any conflicting changes. Coders could also make a branch (which was a copy of the repository) and create a bunch of commits on that branch and merge those in too, but the mental model was still of some central place with a single “canonical” reality that the group of coders was updating.",

The detailed story of another example of this—about how AOL, GEnie, and Prodigy created chat-rooms, news services and all kinds of proprietary value-add on top of the primary feature of the internet’s SMTP protocol that provided the core service, email—is one I will tell some other time.

It’s a commit to treat as a starting point for a series of changes. Unlike Google Docs which just has a single revision history, Syn provides, at the low level, a space for multiple version histories based simply on which session users join and start making changes. With merging, the realities these branches represent can become aligned. Because Syn supports generalized UI for creating/viewing/switching sessions and can insert the merging strategy defined by the particular app, this is a powerful pattern that used to be available only to coders using git. Now, suddenly, it can be applied to arbitrary collaboration apps. In a way, it’s two-level collaboration, synchronously on the “same” state, and asynchronously on divergent/convergent state.",

            "Imagine Wikipedia articles with multiple branches that reflect the true differences we have rather than just being fights in the talk pages, frozen around the assumption that there is a single, neutral point-of-view. And because of their many branches, they can actually merge when people find a way to represent those divergences in ways that can be understood by those who were arguing. That’s next-level collaboration.",
            "Imagine creating branched spreadsheets where each branch models entirely different scenarios off of a core set of assumptions that can then get merged together as reality shows us what happens. That’s next level collaboration.",
            "Imagine the concrete vocabulary of conflict resolution that emerges as we develop new and interesting merge strategies for conflicting change sets in different application contexts. What does it mean to resolve two different color choices applied to the same object by different people in a drawing program? I can imagine an ad-hoc Syn app spinning up that lets people on the fly make proposals and vote, or do rock-paper-scissors, or whatever… all as part of resolving a merge conflict in another Syn app!

            "In one sense, Holochain is quite a simple piece of software: it’s a lightweight framework that allows people to create and share data in a way that ensures accuracy without relying on concentrated power-brokers. It’s not an application layer in and of itself, and it’s highly neutral as to the kinds of applications that are built with it. And it’s unburdened by many of the complications of web2 (where data is subject to centralized control, surveillance, censorship, and points of failure) or early web3 (where global consensus mechanisms and massive data replication result in high computing costs and slow processing).",
            "In another sense, though, Holochain is highly complex: there’s actually a lot of technology that goes into ensuring data integrity without centralized components. This is partly because Holochain is a networking system, and any networking system has to deal with many ‘states’ of data (across many computers) by either updating them all together or otherwise integrating them with one another. But it’s also because Holochain doesn’t force the network into a universally shared state (which would result in enclosure points) but rather enables massive simultaneity of perspectives.",

It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a",
            "for it.",
            "If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.",
            "Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.",
            "But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.",
            "So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the",
            ", the",
            ", and this",
            "about a recent change to arcs.",
            "Previously, we were using something called a",
            ". It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.",
            "The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.",
            "Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.",
            "Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.",
            "[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.]",
            "rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.",
            "There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.",

            "So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.",
            "But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘",

In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.",
            "Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing.

It comes preinstalled in the Launcher and powers both the App Store feature and the DevHub UI. And in the future it will be integrated into the Holo suite to allow ‘hApp managers’ — either developers or people forking a hApp for their group’s personal use — to get their hApps onto HoloPorts.",
            "The original DevHub had a few DNAs that worked together as one to provide all package data — both blobs and metadata such as manifests. Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.",
            "The new DevHub is broken into two hApps with multiple DNAs:",
            "The original DevHub DNA(s) live in one hApp, which is only activated if you turn on the ‘developer mode’ switch in the Launcher settings.",

            "A portal DNA is bundled with both of the above hApps, and it handles communication between the two of them.",
            "If a peer belongs to the DevHub DHT, they’ll advertise that fact on the portal DHT. You could call them a package host, because they’re participating in the storage of package blobs. Anyone who wants to download a package can look up that list of hosts, choose a random one, and ask it for the package data.",
            "This is a great example of a multi-DNA architecture that breaks up responsibility according to needs, abilities, and roles in the community. The",
            "is a generic DNA that you can drop into your hApp to provide the bridging between a DHT of hosts and a DHT of clients. In the future, Holochain will support ‘deferred DNA provisioning’ which will eliminate the need to split this sort of functionality into two separate hApps, allowing you to bundle the host DNA and only activate it for those who want to be hosts.",

This isn’t a bug but a side effect of small DHTs. We’re testing the deployment of persistent DevHub and App Store nodes on the Holo network, and that will help with this issue in the near future.",

We’re nearing a stable 0.2.2 release which tackles some of the biggest performance issues, but further improvements will still come after that point.",
            "As a developer, you’ve probably had the experience of polishing up your application, running it through CI tests one more time (all green!), cutting a release, and… getting a bug report from someone who hit some obscure corner of your code or tried to use it in OS or networking conditions you’d never dreamed of. Even the most well-tested code is vulnerable to the kind of creative challenges the real world likes to throw at it.",
            "Holochain’s CI test suite has checks for performance regressions — it generally has to pass a certain level of responsiveness before a release can be cut.

It turned out that, in large networks with lots of data, network latency and bandwidth caused gossip bottlenecks at unexpected moments. Aborted and restarted gossip sessions were creating race conditions, causing network connection pool saturations that took a while to clear out.",
            "So of course the core devs are tackling these specific bottlenecks. But they’re also building their capacity to respond to future issues of this kind. You can’t predict the next black swan, but you can work on your ability to respond to the unexpected. This is happening in two ways:",
            "Application architecture is getting streamlined so that it’s easier to reason about the flow of control and data through a node. This will make it possible to find out exactly what’s happening during a bottleneck, capture the inputs, outputs, and system state, and replay the scenario.",

For digital works the mechanism is reasonably reliable: a unique ‘hash’, or fingerprint, of the digital file is created and stored as part of the token. But for non-digital works, the mechanism breaks down. There’s no way to be sure that the NFT you’re buying is the NFT that corresponds to the piece of land, the boat, or the painting in question. It’s a version of blockchain’s oracle problem: with everyone being anonymous and no central authority, it’s virtually impossible to incorporate real-world events (such as the creation of a painting) into on-chain events (such as designating a token to uniquely represent the painting). For this reason, blockchain-based NFTs have so far focused on digital works only – quite a major limitation.",

(Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.",
            "The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.",
            "And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted.

Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.",

There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote.

To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm.

This is a simple fact of physics. In the client–server paradigm this isn’t even a problem, because we start from a centralized server where there is a canonical notion of what the data is and a canonical time. The central server stores the data reality. The brilliance of blockchain is that it provides a protocol for distributed peers to hold data reality together, be it the order of transaction of Bitcoins, or the ordering of computation steps on Ethereum. But it does this by enforcing a single ordering of events. The stupidity of blockchain is that the protocol it uses to enforce this single ordering of events is incredibly expensive, extremely wasteful of computation power, and generates obscene amounts of greenhouse gases. On top of all that, for almost all distributed collaborative applications it's not even necessary to keep one single global ordering of events. It’s easy to make this mistake of thinking so if your purpose is a trustless system that’s trying to track the location of digital coins, but it turns out that you can still solve that same problem a different way.",

The detailed story of another example of this—about how AOL, GEnie, and Prodigy created chat-rooms, news services and all kinds of proprietary value-add on top of the primary feature of the internet’s SMTP protocol that provided the core service, email—is one I will tell some other time. But the key there is that proprietary value-add was erased by the arrival of another set of open protocols: http and HTML.

It’s a commit to treat as a starting point for a series of changes. Unlike Google Docs which just has a single revision history, Syn provides, at the low level, a space for multiple version histories based simply on which session users join and start making changes. With merging, the realities these branches represent can become aligned. Because Syn supports generalized UI for creating/viewing/switching sessions and can insert the merging strategy defined by the particular app, this is a powerful pattern that used to be available only to coders using git. Now, suddenly, it can be applied to arbitrary collaboration apps. In a way, it’s two-level collaboration, synchronously on the “same” state, and asynchronously on divergent/convergent state.",

It's not the number of users, but the price of its currency. As the price increase, more people want a share of the earnings, so they start mining. And that increased price makes it more attractive to attacks, so in a strangely elegant way the security increases with the vulnerability.

This new form of engagement or interaction was first seen in some of the centralised platforms for musicians.

And what he’s discovered is that you can understand any complex subject if you break it down into bite-sized pieces that build on pieces you already understand. The goal is to find the shortest path through an infinite landscape of ideas, building each idea upon the last. Sounds pretty obvious, but it’s an art — it’s hard to design a curriculum that does this well.

The curriculum team — Marcus, Muhammad, and Guillem Cordoba — applied this rule rigorously to every concept, shaping and reshaping each slide until it was brief yet thorough.",

            "in your learning journey you will get it wrong — and that’s okay.",

If they find any suspicious activity, they sound the alarm.

This change happens every time you update to a new HDK version, even if there aren’t any of the above sorts of changes.

            "I’m still searching for better language, to distinguish different kinds of break. Until I find the right words, I’ll just clarify whether a change breaks your code versus compatibility with the host API. If I say ‘no breaking changes’, however, know that you can still break compatibility with prior copies of your DNA’s compiled WASM simply by recompiling — HDK upgrade or not."

There’s an inability to move beyond the boundaries that exist within ourselves, which creates division between people and the inability to connect on a deeper level. I went to speak with one of my mentors. We discussed how social media tends to perpetuate the problem in terms of external validation of our self-worth and over-analysis of sharing. We thought that just a shift of awareness in and of itself could cause positive change interactions. An idea evolved for a new kind of social media."

Here’s how it was to work: When an energy-consuming node (say, a campus building) wanted to buy energy, it would open itself to receive bids from a marketplace of energy producers (say, on-campus power generation equipment or national grid companies) for a future time period. These producers would respond by generating bids for slots they wanted to provide power for, writing them to their data stores, and privately communicating them to the consumer. On receiving each bid, the consumer node would record it in their own data store. And periodically (once or twice a second) they would write a ‘market plan’ entry consisting of all the bids they’d received so far. Lastly, the final market plan would get shared with all the bidders.",

Community-led dev camps, meetups, documentation efforts, contributions to Holochain Core, open-source library collaborations, chat conversations, and plenty of healthy feedback and critique on Holochain itself are making the ecosystem much stronger than our small team ever could by itself. Just like RedGrid, we feel like it’s making Holochain resilient and well-equipped to take on the challenges of bringing a new way of building software into the world."

            "I think the big story here is how encouraging it is to see an ecosystem of creators and builders supporting each other to help bring one player’s vision to life. But the numbers are interesting in their own right, to show just how much Holochain RSM has improved over the previous version.",
            "So first I’d like to give some more details about the test as I understand it from talking to Mike, Connor, and Guillem. (Sorry to the three of you if I get some details wrong!) As I go along I’ll try to interpret the results for you.",
            "Each market period spans nominally 24 hours, and bidders can bid on as many five-minute intervals in that period as they like. Each bid consists of about 1 kb of data. Because the consumer node has to record each bid it receives, the activity in the bidding window’s time period is a good test of throughput, or write ops per second. (In the blockchain world this would get called transactions per second, or TPS, although this isn’t a terribly meaningful metric to apply to Holochain—more on that later.) None of the entries are public, so they don’t have to be published to the DHT, but they are written to their authors’ personal journals and broadcast to the appropriate parties. This is where latency matters. And finally, the market plans get quite large—by the end of the test, the final market plan is about 100 kb. This tests Holochain’s ability to write large blobs without choking.",
            "Monash didn’t want to artificially cripple this test in any way; they wanted RedGrid to hold Holochain’s feet to the fire in order to get a sense of how it might perform in the real world. (Mike tells me that a marketplace network might consist of tens of thousands of nodes, each of whom can be both producer and consumer simultaneously.)",
            ", these",
            "running in appliances, energy generation/storage hardware, buildings, or energy companies’ offices; for the purpose of the demo it was enough to use multiple",
            "containers on one physical machine (and besides, RedGrid weren’t able to directly access the devices in Monash’s lab during",
            "). That means that wire latency wasn’t being tested, just latency of the system itself. Additionally, because the team had to use node.js middleware in place of the not-yet-implemented Holochain P2P network transport, the speed of the middleware contributed to the latency figures. (Mike suspects that it added latency.)",
            "Here’s a graph of how the consumer node fared in the RSM demo. It doesn’t capture initial spin-up of the application (which causes a momentary CPU spike to 100%); it just captures the consumer node’s ability to keep up with all the bids it’s receiving.",
            "Each bidder is throttled to send only three bids per second. 29 bidders × 3 bids/sec = 87 write ops per second; the consumer node is able to handle everything the bidders can throw at it.",
            "The initial spike in activity is accompanied by a modest CPU spike of only 40%. A big reason for this improvement over the previous version of Holochain is that the core team has put a lot of work into improving",
            ", removing bottlenecks in places where threads were waiting for other threads to finish. (When testing HoloFuel on the previous version of Holochain, we found that this problem compounded when you introduced multiple nodes.)",
            "RAM also stays nice and low. Optimal use of the database engine (",
            ") is responsible for most of this, and the core team is constantly watching how they use and tune LMDB to keep a good balance between memory consumption and disk swapping latency.",
            "We see ops/sec tapering off as the test continues, yet CPU and RAM don’t appear to be bottlenecks. The RedGrid dev team suspects that this may be due to unsynchronised bidding times—that is, bidders start at roughly the same time but some finish early.",
            "I’m eager to follow RedGrid’s future testing efforts. I asked them why they throttled bidder nodes. They explained that, when bid frequency increased, the consumer node hit a bug that caused it to go to 100% CPU and hang. A fix is already in the works and will be committed soon; It’ll be interesting to see what test results will look like at that point (my prediction is that we’ll see another >5× improvement). Guillem also shared with me that architectural changes to their TEM app, such as relying more on the DHT, might improve throughput by an order of magnitude as well."

The concept of a switch-board, which maintains active websocket connections to each agent that is online, works much better with all the assumptions that have been made in other parts of the Holochain stack -- mainly Holochain core, as well as lib3h. In fact, that central component of sim2h borrows a lot from already existing pieces and in essence is like the in-memory network that we’ve used in core for local testing of multiple instances (i.e. mocking the network in-memory).

That’s because, in all alpha test networks, and potentially in early betas, we definitely want to be able to log network messages as needed in order to gain a global view for debugging. So we believe the single point of failure is a reasonable trade-off (during alpha and early beta phases) for the ability to analyse the network.

Even if the whole Holochain stack worked without any bugs and quirks (though we do expect some bugs—that’s why it’s called alpha), there would still be lots of hApps (both our internal as well as external hApps) that will need debugging.",
            "Exactly for this reason we were planning to have Holochain nodes and HoloPorts send logs and other state information to a single node for diagnostics anyway. Sim1h just takes this idea to another level, and reduces work, since it is running as a simulated network that lets us see all the information that nodes are exchanging without having to implement special debugging and analytics code. Usually, distributed applications don’t let anyone see all information being exchanged on the network, but this is crucial for accurate and quick debugging.",

Holochain core, with it’s overlay network of AgentIDs, is working fine within the boundaries of its tests and in-memory network. Lib3h is working fine within the test suites that try to mock a real-world usage. However, putting two built-out and complicated pieces together after developing each in isolation led to all sorts of complex behaviors that take quite some effort to analyse, test out, and debug. Eric described some of this in a",

I am personally even more excited about the evolutionary path this enables because we can now take and replace pieces of the whole system in small iterations. For example with sim1h we can  tackle Holochain’s direct messages in a peer-to-peer manner, while the DHT gossip and queries still run through the simulated network. And then as a next step we’ll be able to easily pull in lib3h’s DHT code into a single simulation and prove that the high-level logic and our new DHT algorithms work fine (without implementing a full peer-to-peer DHT - and testing that simultaneously). And we can do all of that, before adding the complexity involved with low-level connection handling, NAT traversal, peer discovery, etc. This provides huge improvements for us in terms of time-to-delivery and testing capabilities."

Thus far we’ve had over 750 HoloPorts registered in 50+ countries, out of 1500 hundred total that have been shipped. The next two releases of the HoloPortOS will include fixes for some of the bugs we’ve seen. They will also enable HoloPort to login to HP Admin and play with a test version of HoloFuel. We’re excited about this step, because it finally puts real hApps into the hands of the people who will be hosting the Next Net. Our Service Operations team will continue to be the ears of the org, listening to hosts’ successes and struggles as they use hApps for the first time."

Philosopher Adam Smith called this the ‘",

This simplification supports aggregation and generalisation but it can’t anticipate the complex and surprising things that happen when a bunch of individuals get together and interact. At best, it vaguely asserts that scale does not matter and a description for an individual is also a description for a market. But in reality, we see this theory break down in catastrophic ways in an unequal world; it seems that the invisible hand has always had tremors.",

But she also acknowledges that there are blind spots in such a theory too: its abstract models and aggregated data sets take a big-picture view, and it doesn’t offer an explanation or prescription for individual behaviour. As such, it doesn’t tell us how we can organise our individual decisions for better global outcomes.",

It would be great, she says, if there were something that could combine the micro’s individual behaviour approach with the macro’s systems thinking lens. A sort of ‘grand unified model’ for economics.",

She claims that this bookkeeping ‘in the open’ is the thing that could align macroeconomic models more closely with the reality of interdependent individuals.

            "At this point, my mind begins to drift back home — could this be useful at the micro level too? If global markets are inefficient because we lack information and power, could Valueflows make more local flows visible, helping us make better decisions in the places where our choices matter? If we could all see unmet needs and unused resources around us, perhaps new businesses would emerge to close those gaps. This would in turn bring the feedback loops between our actions and their consequences closer to home, giving us even more information for wise decision-making.",
            "Dr Ussher’s vision goes beyond mere commerce. With Valueflows, individuals, households, corporates, and governments are not the only agents that make choices and are held accountable; trees, rivers, animals, even the atmosphere could be represented as agents, with rights, duties and decisions via carefully designed smart contracts. As we build an accounting ecosystem of agents, resources and processes with a rich body of shared data, we will be able to see more clearly how our individual — and collective — decisions impact our planet and each other.",

Rather than mere escapism underwritten by advertising money, Valueflows could equip it to become a tool for creating ‘digital twins’ of agents (human and non-human) and resources (artificial and natural, concrete and abstract) and giving them legitimacy in our economics systems.",
            "For my own pedagogical purposes I define the Metaverse as a digital twin of the real world. We have been in a Metaverse of sorts for decades. The Metaverse can be much more than a 1:1 mapping, just as the real world can be more than a 1:1 mapping with the Metaverse.",

This is what excites her most about Valueflows, because it carries the promise of including all entities that we regard as important, holding all participants accountable, and designing features to rebalance inequities in market power, rights, and duties. By giving the biosphere rights, we can internalise externalities. This is nearer than you might think — legal systems are already recognising",

            "Sansone and Schwartz were attracted to hREA because it’s expressive enough to model the complexity of the rich web of relationships they’re weaving. They intend to record details about the raw materials and the processes they went through, such as transport miles and climate-beneficial verifications, so customers can see exactly what went into their garments. They also want individual designers to be able to merge their buying power, simplifying procurement and reducing costs for everyone.",
            "With this complexity comes a lot of administration, so they’re looking forward to using hREA to automate most of that. As a generic toolkit that uses a simple ontology for building all sorts of economic applications, it can be used for bookkeeping, inventory, supply chain management, certification tracking, enterprise resource planning, alternative currencies, and even sharing of production process recipes.",
            "Listening to Schwartz explain their vision, I wonder what the value proposition is for designers. It sounds like they might struggle to understand why they would want to be more transparent, choosing to give up the competitive edge that",
            "give them. He answers my concerns before I even voice them: This isn’t meant for the Ralph Laurens and Patagonias out there. They already have their supply chains in place, and they’re already working to answer customers’ demand for more visibly ethical sourcing.",
            "This is meant for small designers and light industry, in order to grow a more horizontal economic model — the recent design school grad who’s starting her brand with a production run of only 20 sweaters, the small farmer only raising a few dozen animals, the ‘mini mill’ that is currently serving ‘handcrafters’. These people currently don’t have the power to compete in the same way; the landscape of potential suppliers is challenging to navigate, and as individuals they don’t have the ability to meet minimum order quantities, nor the purchasing power to make their production economical. The patterns Sansone and Schwartz are building are giving these smaller designers the ability to enter the market — as well as giving sustainable livelihoods to local farmers and regional processors.",
            "In this flow diagram, designers operate with vulnerable transparency, exposing their supply chain intelligence as open-source production ‘recipes’. They collaborate on both their buying power and their learnings. This provides an interdependence that makes small-scale production more efficient and boosts everyone’s success.",
            "Listening more deeply, I realise that they’re actually building an open-source economic model for the textile industry — and local markets in general. In the logic of this economy, everyone succeeds when supply chain relationships and other intellectual property are shared. And Sansone and Schwartz plan to share their templates as they evolve, enabling other local production economies to spring up across the world.",
            "And more than that — they’re building an economy that functions ecologically. Ecosystems don’t usually create chains, because chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Instead, ecosystems create",

There is no server in a Holochain app; each user simply connects to other users’ machines to share data and make transactions. And when two networks want to start interacting with each other — as in the case of Sensorica collaborating with a copywriting community in Brazil — the barrier is low, because each participant has full access to the data in the spaces they belong to. This lays the foundation for highly interoperable applications.",

It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a",
            "for it.",
            "If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.",
            "Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.",
            "But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.",
            "So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the",
            ", the",
            ", and this",
            "about a recent change to arcs.",
            "Previously, we were using something called a",
            ". It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.",
            "The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.",
            "Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.",
            "Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.",
            "[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.]",
            "rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.",
            "There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.",

            ")",
            "So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.",
            "But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘",
            "’ their chain.",
            "Enzymatic countersigning partially solves this problem. In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.",
            "Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing.

While HoloPorts store and propagate entries in the decentralized fashion consistent with Holochain, users can instruct a hosted hApp using an ordinary web browser. All users need to do is log in with a username and password, just as you would on any other website. The connection is end-to-end encrypted (TLS terminates at the HoloPort, not the Holo gateway).",

Crucially, there is NO requirement for hardware wallets, key store files, or other things typically associated with accessing decentralized networks such as Bitcoin. While this makes the process of accessing a hApp really user friendly, the setup does have potential weaknesses:",

            "Traffic for hosted hApps has to be routed through Holo’s distributed gateway infrastructure. While this infrastructure may contain security gaps that could be exploited by bad actors, we have made it as secure as possible (e.g., SNI, E2E encryption, etc.).",
            "Our approach to handling these issues has been to develop a secure",
            "we’re calling",
            ". The application generates keys from the username and password and securely manages them within the browser—essentially, the same process as key generation in Holochain. Chaperone also handles all zome calls and signing, which means the hApp UI does not have direct access to a user’s login information. Developers using the Holo Hosting web SDK would only interact with Chaperone through the Cross-Origin Message Bus (COMB) library. COMB is our library that wraps the built-in window messenger (",
            "), making the API more user friendly by adding request/reply, async/await, and other features.",

Note: If you were to lose your login information, Holo would not have any way to recover it, so make sure you take steps to prevent that from happening.",
            "If you’re interested in seeing what Chaperone can do, you can use our front end SDK to run a local development instance to test conductors directly without having to connect to a network and a HoloPort. We encourage you to check this out when it’s available for public release."

We’ve been experimenting with it recently and it’s exciting to witness these improvements."

            "One of the biggest challenges in developing complex hApps with multiple bridges and DNAs has been making sure deployment works—not just now, but in the future. During our early development phases, the pattern was for hApp developers to do a lot of manual tweaking (like using environment variables or npm scripts) to manage things like instance IDs and RPC interface ports. Essentially this amounted to having to manipulate the whole conductor configuration file. The approach often locked devs into one deployment route. For example, if you started developing in a self-contained environment, there wasn’t a straightforward way to switch to Holoscape or Holo Hosting if and when it was required or desired.",
            "This situation came about for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was not until August that we had ‘hApp bundles’, the specifications that define the components of a fully working hApp. They indicate the DNAs and bridges that comprise the back end, as well as an optional, web-based UI package for the front end. The hApp bundle format lets a developer give their own consistent IDs to components without worrying about the user’s existing runtime configuration. This makes hApp deployment a lot more dependable and user friendly.",
            "Secondly, there was no way for devs to use hApp bundles in the development process. We’ve always intended to give them the tools to create runtime-agnostic hApps, which is why we're announcing a new addition to `hc run`. This update will allow you to use hApp bundles during development, and will be included in the next release.",
            "As a kind of manifest for all the parts that will be called upon at runtime, `hc run` will now first look for a `bundle.toml` file in the current working directory. It will then read the file (if present) and configure its internal conductor to implement that hApp bundle—in other words, add all the instances, bridges, and UIs (via its static HTTP server) and run them. Otherwise, it will create an instance of the DNA in the current working directory as before.",
            "With this change, even if you only have one DNA, hApp development should start with writing a hApp bundle. This makes the hApp project future-proof for deployment. The hApp code should make no assumptions about the environment in which it is executed, other than what’s explicitly named in the hApp bundle. Although hApp bundles are not absolutely necessary, they are a must if you roll your own deployment (e.g., put a conductor into an iOS app and manage the UI yourself), want to use the hApp store, or deploy to Holoscape or Holo Hosting."

The near-term solutions we’ve chosen at the moment—AWS and DynamoDB—both have their own issues when it comes to interacting with Holochain components.

As we discussed a few weeks ago, its predecessor, sim1h, allowed us to test the complete Holochain technology stack—but only through a test network with a traditional back-end collecting data as it’s being transmitted.

Remember to use a public server ONLY if you’re amenable to your messages being logged for debugging purposes."

It’s a project created by an international group of professors, and it aims to build tools that help communities understand and be more intentional about their impact on the planet. And because the economy’s tendrils are woven through every aspect of our society and environment, part of this work means developing a much more accurate way of seeing our economy within its geography.",

And what’s true of an individual, they reason, is true of the sum of these individuals, or the economy: given a whole marketplace of these mythical self-interested, intelligent decision-makers, things will settle into the most beneficial situation for everyone. Philosopher Adam Smith called this the ‘",
            "’ of the market, and many economists since have grounded their economic theories on a faith in this principle. And things do seem to work this way — for simple, competitive markets that we make easy to understand.",
            "But that’s not true of most real markets. Dr Ussher’s complaint of traditional macroeconomic theory is that it assumes individual independence. This simplification supports aggregation and generalisation but it can’t anticipate the complex and surprising things that happen when a bunch of individuals get together and interact. At best, it vaguely asserts that scale does not matter and a description for an individual is also a description for a market. But in reality, we see this theory break down in catastrophic ways in an unequal world; it seems that the invisible hand has always had tremors.",

It creates models founded on theories of the entire economic system, populates those models with big aggregate data, and uses the output to inform policies of regional and national governments and international trade.",
            "This is the school of thought that Dr Ussher comes from. But she also acknowledges that there are blind spots in such a theory too: its abstract models and aggregated data sets take a big-picture view, and it doesn’t offer an explanation or prescription for individual behaviour. As such, it doesn’t tell us how we can organise our individual decisions for better global outcomes.",
            "Dr Ussher explains that micro- and macroeconomics both have their place, but they’re taught as separate classes in university and there isn’t really any good way to reconcile the two. It would be great, she says, if there were something that could combine the micro’s individual behaviour approach with the macro’s systems thinking lens. A sort of ‘grand unified model’ for economics.",
            "Then she says something that surprises me: Valueflows, the economic grammar at the heart of hREA, offers a path in this direction. It records the flow of resources between individuals, but it records them from an",

She claims that this bookkeeping ‘in the open’ is the thing that could align macroeconomic models more closely with the reality of interdependent individuals. And while she acknowledges that this could have serious consequences for privacy and autonomy if done wrong, she’s also thrilled about the immense potential if done right.",
            "At this point, my mind begins to drift back home — could this be useful at the micro level too? If global markets are inefficient because we lack information and power, could Valueflows make more local flows visible, helping us make better decisions in the places where our choices matter? If we could all see unmet needs and unused resources around us, perhaps new businesses would emerge to close those gaps. This would in turn bring the feedback loops between our actions and their consequences closer to home, giving us even more information for wise decision-making.",
            "Dr Ussher’s vision goes beyond mere commerce. With Valueflows, individuals, households, corporates, and governments are not the only agents that make choices and are held accountable; trees, rivers, animals, even the atmosphere could be represented as agents, with rights, duties and decisions via carefully designed smart contracts. As we build an accounting ecosystem of agents, resources and processes with a rich body of shared data, we will be able to see more clearly how our individual — and collective — decisions impact our planet and each other.",

Rather than mere escapism underwritten by advertising money, Valueflows could equip it to become a tool for creating ‘digital twins’ of agents (human and non-human) and resources (artificial and natural, concrete and abstract) and giving them legitimacy in our economics systems.",
            "For my own pedagogical purposes I define the Metaverse as a digital twin of the real world. We have been in a Metaverse of sorts for decades. The Metaverse can be much more than a 1:1 mapping, just as the real world can be more than a 1:1 mapping with the Metaverse.",

This is what excites her most about Valueflows, because it carries the promise of including all entities that we regard as important, holding all participants accountable, and designing features to rebalance inequities in market power, rights, and duties. By giving the biosphere rights, we can internalise externalities. This is nearer than you might think — legal systems are already recognising",

            "Laura Sansone is a textile designer and Adjunct Professor of Sustainable Textile Design at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, NY. When she moved to the Hudson Valley, about an hour north of New York City, she became good friends with the orchardist who leased her new property. She saw him selling his produce at a farmer’s market in NYC one weekend, so they got to talking about local food systems. She started to wonder —",
            "why do we care so much about local food systems but barely talk about local textiles?",
            "After all, the local food movement was all about understanding and improving the impact of the way we eat, so why don’t we have a similar relationship with what we wear? Her intimacy with the textile and fashion industry, which",
            "and our",
            ", told her that it could stand to learn a lot from the local food movement.",
            "Sansone came to realise that relocalising clothing production is a good deal more challenging; there are a lot more people between a sheep and your sweater than there are between a tomato plant and tonight’s dinner. As a textile designer, she found herself at the very end of a network of producers, processors, and distributors who had already made their own decisions about what materials she could work with.",
            "So she put herself at the front of the supply chain.",
            "As a designer, she reasoned, she would have the power to make impactful choices if she could be involved in the whole process. Starting small, she aggregated wool from several small local farmers, transported it in a borrowed pickup truck, and brought it to the few remaining wool processing facilities in the New York bioregion — one of which was just a farmer with a handful of washing machines in her garage to wash the animal fibers.",
            "This wasn’t meant to turn into a business; it was just supposed to prove that Sansone’s idea for a local textile economy could work. However, she soon found herself selling her yarn to other designers, and eventually creating a line of",

            "Sansone and Schwartz were attracted to hREA because it’s expressive enough to model the complexity of the rich web of relationships they’re weaving. They intend to record details about the raw materials and the processes they went through, such as transport miles and climate-beneficial verifications, so customers can see exactly what went into their garments. They also want individual designers to be able to merge their buying power, simplifying procurement and reducing costs for everyone.",
            "With this complexity comes a lot of administration, so they’re looking forward to using hREA to automate most of that. As a generic toolkit that uses a simple ontology for building all sorts of economic applications, it can be used for bookkeeping, inventory, supply chain management, certification tracking, enterprise resource planning, alternative currencies, and even sharing of production process recipes.",
            "Listening to Schwartz explain their vision, I wonder what the value proposition is for designers. It sounds like they might struggle to understand why they would want to be more transparent, choosing to give up the competitive edge that",
            "give them. He answers my concerns before I even voice them: This isn’t meant for the Ralph Laurens and Patagonias out there. They already have their supply chains in place, and they’re already working to answer customers’ demand for more visibly ethical sourcing.",
            "This is meant for small designers and light industry, in order to grow a more horizontal economic model — the recent design school grad who’s starting her brand with a production run of only 20 sweaters, the small farmer only raising a few dozen animals, the ‘mini mill’ that is currently serving ‘handcrafters’. These people currently don’t have the power to compete in the same way; the landscape of potential suppliers is challenging to navigate, and as individuals they don’t have the ability to meet minimum order quantities, nor the purchasing power to make their production economical. The patterns Sansone and Schwartz are building are giving these smaller designers the ability to enter the market — as well as giving sustainable livelihoods to local farmers and regional processors.",
            "In this flow diagram, designers operate with vulnerable transparency, exposing their supply chain intelligence as open-source production ‘recipes’. They collaborate on both their buying power and their learnings. This provides an interdependence that makes small-scale production more efficient and boosts everyone’s success.",
            "Listening more deeply, I realise that they’re actually building an open-source economic model for the textile industry — and local markets in general. In the logic of this economy, everyone succeeds when supply chain relationships and other intellectual property are shared. And Sansone and Schwartz plan to share their templates as they evolve, enabling other local production economies to spring up across the world.",

There is no server in a Holochain app; each user simply connects to other users’ machines to share data and make transactions. And when two networks want to start interacting with each other — as in the case of Sensorica collaborating with a copywriting community in Brazil — the barrier is low, because each participant has full access to the data in the spaces they belong to.

Understanding how the transactor works is important—not only for hApp developers, but also for promoting network user adoption as a way to provide asset backing of the currency. Holo and Holochain are promoting HoloFuel as the micro-currency that powers the Holo Hosting network."

It is perhaps the most critical component in building out the HoloFuel ecosystem within the larger Holo ecosystem. Making sure the transactor works properly, particularly when it comes to payments and hosting, is a priority for us as we progress through the Alpha Testnet.",
            "The HoloFuel transactor is the hApp for sending and receiving HoloFuel, and similar in many respects to a Bitcoin wallet. We’ve already shown you what the UI will look like from the user’s perspective, but it’s important to remember that the UI acts as a bridge to the HoloFuel transactor, which is where the actual process of moving HoloFuel to various destinations takes place. We therefore want you to see the underlying product functions and what makes our approach to HoloFuel different from other digital currencies.",
            "The key element that distinguishes the HoloFuel transactor from others is its agent-centric design. In other words, it is up to both the sender and receiver of HoloFuel to sign transactions confirming them. This marks a difference from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar currencies, where only the sender signs the transaction. This simple distinction creates a more accountable experience, yet intuitive and forgiving, experience.",

          "content": [
            "A HoloFuel transaction goes through a series of verification and signing stages. Until the recipient has committed the transaction to their source chain, it remains in a pending state. You therefore have a window in which you can cancel the transaction if you accidentally send someone fundsor find suspicious activity on your counterparty’s source chain. Already, you can see an advantage over blockchain-based currencies, in which transactions—even accidental or fraudulent ones—are irrevocable once sent. This pending state also helps eliminate the frustrating cryptocurrency problem of sending HoloFuel to the wrong address."

Like hApp developers, hosts are active participants in the HoloFuel ecosystem and are able to not only send, but issue requests for payment. Again, with our agent-centric approach, if the agent who is being asked to send funds declines to do so, they can reject the request. This gives HoloFuel a user experience on par with modern consumer payment apps like Venmo, PayPal, or WeChat—as well as a smaller learning curve than other digital currencies.",
            "In addition, the request function can be integrated with logging hApps to handle invoicing. This makes it much simpler to build an e-commerce operation fully within Holochain without the need for third-party invoicing or other data collection/storage services—it can be done simply by integrating HoloFuel."

By choosing Holochain, you’re putting your faith in something quite unique, which comes with risks. We acknowledge that, and we’re grateful for your boldness. Even with a rich body of literature on eventual consistency, distributed systems, and cryptographic data structures, you’ll likely be facing design problems that nobody else has faced. So as we learn the best ways of developing and testing hApps, we want to make sure that our learnings bear fruit beyond our teams.",
            "In recent internal tests, HoloFuel would work great for the first day, then performance would slow down. Existing participants would try to verify a transaction by contacting its authors, then timeout and get stuck in a holding pattern. Investigation showed that it was due to the behaviour of HoloPortOS after an upgrade: the HoloPort owner’s source chain would get cleared, but their key would remain the same. Often, the upgrade only contained UI fixes, which meant that the HoloFuel DNA hash (and hence the DHT) persisted between updates. This would cause the user to create a new source chain with the same ID.",
            "If you know about Holochain’s data integrity, you know that this",
            "that says an agent’s",
            "must not branch, because that would create alternate histories and ruin the integrity of the system. But because the HoloPort simply forgot its old source chain, it created awkward situations like:",

            "“It says here that you committed a transaction with Alice yesterday. Could I get the rest of your source chain so I can validate the transaction?”",

            "“What? I don’t know anything about that; I just joined this morning.”",
            "Validator:",
            "“Well, this transaction has your signature on it, so...”",

            "“It says here that you committed a transaction with Alice yesterday…”",
            "These unresolvable conversations eventually ground activity to a halt. We fixed Holochain so that validation would fail if the author’s node can’t produce a validation package. But suddenly, Holochain did what it was supposed to, and marked nearly everyone’s data as invalid.",
            "So we decided to start each testing cycle in a fresh DHT without any history. The simplest way to do this is to change the DNA package so that its hash is different. And the simplest way to do",
            "that",
            "is to change its UUID field, either in the project’s app.json file or the conductor config. We’re currently working on a way to automate the clean-slate DHT policy to make testing cycles faster.",
            "We’re also working on a fix to HoloPortOS that keeps source chains between updates, which will prevent the source chain conflicts in the first place. This will of course be necessary for live hApps.",
            "Even though this has to do with our work fixing bugs in Holochain or HoloPortOS, we still think that the clean-slate DHT technique could be of use to hApp developers. Here are reasons you might want to create a new DNA hash with every testing cycle:",
            "Reproducible context (such as an empty DHT) is important for testing.",
            "You’re seeing unexpected behaviour in your hApp, and you’re not sure if it’s caused by bugs in the DNA or issues in the DHT (or even a bug in Holochain itself). In order to isolate the problem, it’s useful to try reproducing the problem with a clean history.",
            "Sometimes we might release a Holochain update that fixes outstanding validation bugs, at which point you’ll likely want to bump the DNA hash in both testing and live environments to clean up invalid data.",
            "If a problem in your hApp is caused by bugs in your DNA, you will of course not need to do this when you release a new DNA, because its hash will naturally change as a consequence of the bug fixes.",
            "We’ll share more learnings as we test more hApps in the real world. We want our successes to become your successes!",

            "One of the biggest challenges in developing complex hApps with multiple bridges and DNAs has been making sure deployment works—not just now, but in the future. During our early development phases, the pattern was for hApp developers to do a lot of manual tweaking (like using environment variables or npm scripts) to manage things like instance IDs and RPC interface ports. Essentially this amounted to having to manipulate the whole conductor configuration file. The approach often locked devs into one deployment route. For example, if you started developing in a self-contained environment, there wasn’t a straightforward way to switch to Holoscape or Holo Hosting if and when it was required or desired.",
            "This situation came about for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was not until August that we had ‘hApp bundles’, the specifications that define the components of a fully working hApp. They indicate the DNAs and bridges that comprise the back end, as well as an optional, web-based UI package for the front end. The hApp bundle format lets a developer give their own consistent IDs to components without worrying about the user’s existing runtime configuration. This makes hApp deployment a lot more dependable and user friendly.",
            "Secondly, there was no way for devs to use hApp bundles in the development process. We’ve always intended to give them the tools to create runtime-agnostic hApps, which is why we're announcing a new addition to `hc run`. This update will allow you to use hApp bundles during development, and will be included in the next release.",
            "As a kind of manifest for all the parts that will be called upon at runtime, `hc run` will now first look for a `bundle.toml` file in the current working directory. It will then read the file (if present) and configure its internal conductor to implement that hApp bundle—in other words, add all the instances, bridges, and UIs (via its static HTTP server) and run them. Otherwise, it will create an instance of the DNA in the current working directory as before.",
            "With this change, even if you only have one DNA, hApp development should start with writing a hApp bundle. This makes the hApp project future-proof for deployment. The hApp code should make no assumptions about the environment in which it is executed, other than what’s explicitly named in the hApp bundle. Although hApp bundles are not absolutely necessary, they are a must if you roll your own deployment (e.g., put a conductor into an iOS app and manage the UI yourself), want to use the hApp store, or deploy to Holoscape or Holo Hosting."

            "sim2h does not rely on any centralized data persistence!",
            "Instead it plays a role similar to these old telephone switch-boards where an operator takes a request of a network participant and sets up the appropriate connection to another participant (without storing or controlling what those participants say on that line).",
            "Interestingly, this actually reduces complexity compared to the sim1h solution where the network had to be simulated inside a database which meant actually storing messages and then polling for messages on the other end. The concept of a switch-board, which maintains active websocket connections to each agent that is online, works much better with all the assumptions that have been made in other parts of the Holochain stack -- mainly Holochain core, as well as lib3h. In fact, that central component of sim2h borrows a lot from already existing pieces and in essence is like the in-memory network that we’ve used in core for local testing of multiple instances (i.e. mocking the network in-memory). In other words, Sim2h uses the websocket implementation from lib3h to create encrypted “wormholes” between each Holochain conductor instance and this central “in-memory” switch-board.",

            "It is not possible to impersonate an agent/user without access to their keys and source chain and neither are stored at the central component. (That means the principles of our",

            "not",

Sim2h on the other side just facilitates connections between nodes of the same DNA. The state of the DHT is stored exclusively in all the nodes at the edges. Any change has to pass through the DNAs validation rules the same way it would in a fully peer-to-peer setting.",
            "This difference is precisely what enables us to use sim2h right now for our first public Holochain test network. This is also an important prerequisite for Holo’s first test network.",
            "That said, the fact that all messages are routed through a single point creates a single point of failure, which surely is not what you would want for a production ready p2p framework. But it actually is very beneficial for test networks, as already described",
            ". That’s because, in all alpha test networks, and potentially in early betas, we definitely want to be able to log network messages as needed in order to gain a global view for debugging. So we believe the single point of failure is a reasonable trade-off (during alpha and early beta phases) for the ability to analyse the network. And should that central point actually experience issues, we can spawn new machines without even managing any application data, since that is stored at the node level."

            ", is to pull in more lib3h code and implement rrDHT style sharding with sim2h. This is a good example of the benefit that this approach gives us: we can test out high-level assumptions and algorithms just by changing the gossip logic within the sim2h server, which has all the needed information within its local transient memory. It is much easier to iterate on different aspects of the networking implementation and get each aspect (like the sharding algorithms) right, before jumping to a fully decentralized network which is just much harder to analyse.",

In February 2017, the Cabinet Secretariat IT General Strategy Office's Data Distribution Environment Improvement Study Group came up with a statement in which they said that in order to achieve a smooth distribution of large amounts of varied data, they need a system that promotes data distribution and utilization with the involvement of individuals (information banks, etc.). Currently, a legal system that considers the regulations of giant IT companies is being developed in Japan.

The Internet was originally open and was envisioned as a platform where anyone could freely share ideas and opportunities across borders. However, this is not the case now. A few large companies are hosting our personal data under the disguise of “free service” and commercialize our personal identities without our knowledge or consent. In hindsight, it feels like Holo and Holochain are trying to realize the original vision of the Internet.

The whole experience was more ‘community’ than ‘competitive’. In fact, instead of isolated team projects, designers and developers mingled and supported each other to solve problems, build prototypes, and understand more about the deep well of possibility that seems available in Holochain. I certainly felt like a welcome new member of a meaningful project. See you at another Holochain Hackathon in the future.  – Gavriel"

Diorama allowed for simple tests between Holochain instances running on a single conductor. It was intended primarily for third-party Holochain developers to test their zome logic in multi-node scenarios using in-memory networking.When the Holochain Core Dev Team needed to write its own end-to-end tests, they turned to Diorama. However, Diorama could only handle a single conductor, which meant they couldn’t get a good picture of how the networking code was actually running.",

There has been some confusion in the dev community, even within internal Holochain teams, about how to proceed. A single tool for all conditions would be highly preferable and would help to consolidate the gains we have made in our testing framework."

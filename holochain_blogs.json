            "DAO’s promise a way for individuals to collectively own and manage internet-native enterprises. Many speak of collaboration and community. They seek a future where everyone has the ability to access communities of their choosing and to lead lives as free agents, uninhibited by the rule of institutions, governments, and third parties. We applaud this drive for freedom. However, we often see  DAOs fall short with their aversion to the messy parts of human organizing and community building.",
            "The DAO’s  external  actions function autonomously via smart contracts based on votes, tokenomics, or the community’s other power distribution mechanisms. Internally though we often find a deficit in the community’s ability to manage conflict. Further, the reliance on coded and autonomous action creates an environment where the individual and the collective are estranged. Rather than a community, we find a collection of individuals in competition with each other for support of their ideas and motions. All this is embodied in the  explicit trustlessness  of on-chain operations. In contrast, the felt community and its day-to-day activities and decisions of many DAOs actually exists in the centralized off-chain world of forums and Discord channels, belying the very premise of these organizations.",
            "SACs attempt to bridge this gap. Rather than pushing the hard parts of collaboration and organization to deterministic, coded solutions, we seek instead to use code-enhanced spaces and sense-making tools to support individuals in co-creating community and digging into the messy parts of human interaction."

            "Sovereign Accountable Commons are coded spaces following a set of fundamental principles in order to collectivize interaction, forming a space where  the interests and actions of the individual and the collective don’t collide, but rather mutually reinforce each other.",

            {
              "lists": [
                "Mutually consented to rulesets which allow peers to operate in a context of equity and clarity.",

            },
            "Note that these three principles require each other in order to provide the desired outcome. Let’s examine these properties in more detail.",
            "Communities begin simply as collections of individuals, which grow to be more than the sum of their parts because of their interaction patterns. Starting from the common ground of explicitly shared, transparent, mutually consented rulesets lays the groundwork for individual alignment with the group. Historically, the rules of physical social spaces have evolved to distribute power to particular people. They inequitably dictate who can speak when, who will be heard, and who will receive benefit. Breaking this equity failure for digital spaces requires a new capacity that begins with and maintains the ability to be explicit about the rules of engagement.",
            "Uncapturable mediums of communication  create the conditions for transparency. Think of sitting around a campfire. Everyone can speak and no one can snatch another’s words out of the air. To disrupt someone’s speaking you must speak over them; you must act openly in the public sphere. The exercise of power becomes transparent in the medium and thus makes it uncapturable. In contrast, we can see an example of capture with Amazon banning particular words in their warehouse worker’s internal communications in order to disable attempts at unionizing. The company and workers have asymmetric abilities to communicate and control information, and hold asymmetric relationships to the visibility of that control.",
            "Accountability requires us to be able to tell accurate stories about what has happened, and everyone’s voices matter to attain that accuracy.  SACs enforce individual’s accountability to each other and their community by having everyone sign everything they say and do, thus recording it in the public sphere. Similarly, because of the consent, transparency, and common-ground of the communications medium, the community becomes accountable to its individual members. If one member is treated unfairly, the community cannot hide it, not even from other communities. Accountability in SACs comes from:",
            {
              "lists": [
                "Provenance:  knowing who said and did what. SACs achieve this through the signing of all speech acts similar to how transactions are signed on the blockchain.",

                "Membranes:  defining the borders of a community (processes of access and removal in the community, transparency of different information, etc.). The group holds both the barriers and affordances to cross between different spaces in common agreement. This provides a context for interaction."
              ]
            },
            "When a context no longer suits part of a community they also have the option of walkaway which helps to maintain consent through the right to disagree. Each member has the ability to fork the community or join another, taking their data and the public data of the community with them. A non-trivial action, we will explore community forking further in the upcoming article  Walkaway or Why Forking Matters .",
            "A SAC that maintains these fundamental properties can take many forms — chat applications or social media platforms come to mind as obvious examples because of the way this description of SACs focuses on social interaction. But a mapping application can benefit from the same principles, as can a film review site or any form of application we might term a “platform”.",
            "DAOs can also benefit from these fundamentals. In order for these principles to apply across the entirety of the DAO, all digital activities of the organization should be performed on SAC compliant applications.  This ensures continuity and keeps members accountable equally to what they post on the community forum as well as their votes on issues of treasury management.  As all Holochain applications are inherently SAC compliant, DAO’s built on Holochain have easy access to these benefits."

            "We desire a freer society where everybody has the ability to choose their own work and right placement — freedom of action and association. With SACs we aim to create an underlying structure, a set of principles for systems of communication and organization in digital space, intended to allow greater freedom and to increase one’s ability to consent to relationships rather than being forced into them by the power of institutions. DAOs are, however, institutions. They are organizations of people who come together to do something collectively that no one person could do on their own. As we go on to describe, following the principles of SACs would allow for a more consensual environment as the proliferation of social spaces provides participants with alternative organizations.",
            "In a SAC the rules of a community become clear, available to any, and mutually created/consented to. Because of this, people gain the ability to choose communities that suit their needs and avoid those that don’t. The capacity to easily create new communities through simple setup protocols and especially walkaway, will greatly increase the variety of communities to join. This fundamentally challenges the monopoly on the internet by large corporate players that dictate the terms of engagement.",
            "This would lead to  right placement : arrangements and relationships where individuals find alignment between their particular skills, desires, and the needs of their community. Sometimes we know more about what we don’t want than what we do want, so SACs can support the discovery process of moving people towards right placement through a combination of engagement and optionality. As communities would not have leverage to force anyone to do what they do not consent to, the pressure to work as a part of the community without the demand then acts to filter people into activities that bring them joy.",
            "Similarly, to quote James Carse in his book  Finite and Infinite Games : “Whoever must play, cannot play.” Thus, choice is a necessary precondition to play. SACs then aim to create room for play through the proliferation of choice and consensual engagement. The ability to collectively rewrite the rules intends to provide infinite spaces and iterations for play, while at the same time building particular contexts for creativity to emerge within.",
            "Imagine a DAO built out of multiple apps running on these fundamentals. People would self-select into communities rather than out of them. With many options for other communities to select into, community members can actually consent to participate rather than having that participation be a necessity. And through an ease of customization, each person can use the version of the apps that they prefer, editing and augmenting as needed to create their ideal digital environment. Building a social space together as a shared commitment, groups can design an experience of meaningful work and community. Each part of the DAO would enable this because the whole structure constantly realigns towards these principles."

            "The set of tools that communities gain through SACs center on remedying the breakdowns in understanding that arise when no longer communicating face to face. Foremost of these is accountability. The tools of provenance and clarity allow the community to mediate and work through disagreements that participants have with each other by finding shared meaning and intent behind the participant’s actions and statements. This transformative justice based response leads to healing rifts in the community. When membranes become involved it is to limit harm and if necessary remove a community member, but the system first acts to add clarity and create shared contexts.",
            "Other tools, like those developed with  Gameshifting , can be used in conjunction with SACs and aim to assist in setting the context of communication, allowing participants to signal their comfort and understanding in a conversation, shift through the different stages of a discussion, and determine the methods used to make decisions.",
            "SACs seek to make the processes and context of discussion, decision, and community explicit.  As addressed previously, the current DAO space views the technical processes as paramount and sees access to a platform equivalent to participation in a community. We see the inverse as true. Communities form out of active participation and interaction. By building shared meaning, communities define themselves.  In a decentralized space, openingly accessible and editable rulesets, combined with the accountability of membranes, provide a path towards this sort of meaning making.  Thus, these aspects of the technical system would provide a space for communities to work through the difficult social dynamics of being in relationship to each other.",
            "We also find the double meaning of accountability important here. Not just accounting for the motion of tokens, but now also the interactions of speech and intent.  The metaphor of accountability refers to both bookkeeping and storytelling.  Through the development of non-monetary currencies, which tell stories about how resources get used, a DAO can go beyond market based methods for collectively managing resources.",
            "Take a watershed for example. A DAO set up to manage water use over hundreds of miles will face difficulties if it only concerns itself with the amount of water which gets used, ignoring information about the how, where, and why. Water, a partially rivalrous good, is free to share, but mismanaging it hurts everyone using it. Broader ecological questions would also come into play, as would divisions of power and governance in subject specific matters based, for instance, on Indigenous groups’ ancestral claim to the land and its management. A DAO used for this purpose might need stricter membranes and governance systems; the DAO might also need to develop new ways of accounting, utilizing unique, shifting metrics for understanding water use. Clarity and consent as well as the evolvability of the community’s rules and organization enable all of this, from the development of metacurrencies to contextual distributions of power based not on token ownership but rather deeper social relationships and connections to particular issues.",
            "Evolution serves as a useful metaphor across SACs.  Because SACs utilize DNA-like grammars — code blocks that enmesh themselves to create particular contexts — communities and applications alike can grow and change as their macro-social context does.  The coded grammar of the app/platform/DAO does not need to remain the same but can rather be added to, changed, or fractured off to create something new. While our watershed DAO might have more issues forking because of the relationships to power in meatspace, it can still evolve over time, for instance to account for new ways of measuring the ecological impact of a dam. The DAO does not have to bind itself to one currency or system of value because SACs maintain integrity even as they shift their protocols and methods of accounting."

          "content": [
            "Let’s quickly consider how SACs help to mediate and enable the merging of protocols and social processes.  A community can define any number of governance methods for different processes depending on their needs, but SACs always require a few key stages for the editing of their rulesets in order to maintain consent and clarity.  Define : the stage of initial proposal and proposition to the community.  Refine : the stage of edits and adaptations, whatever the community input mechanism.  Align : final decision making and enactment of the new rules, whether determined by consensus, a representative vote, or otherwise. This outlines  a   standard that defines the process the community uses to edit standards  and forms the base for all other governance in the community.   The recursivity embedded in this structure allows the social and the protocolary to coexist and maintain their flexibility.",
            "Take the hypothetical example of a community that set in their initial charter the phrase “we will treat all members with respect”. Sometime later a member accuses another of treating them disrespectfully. Documentation of their interactions is available for all to audit, but there remains a lack of clarity on what respect entails. Perhaps cultural understandings of respect clash, each participant working from different traditions of what constitutes “appropriate manners.” In order to collectively remedy the issue, the community does not punish either member for the conflict but rather starts a process to mediate their misunderstanding and to develop greater clarity for the future. This starts with  defining  what respect means and what it means to act towards each other with respect. This initial definition would then be  refined  through community input, perhaps in this case particular input coming from discussions with the members in conflict to rectify the confusion that initiated their dispute. Other input might come from a comment period or a survey managed by predefined parties. Finally the community either accepts or rejects the proposal in the  alignment  phase. These stages focus on the social, but translate that process to effect code. Whatever the social governance process, the accountability mechanisms of SACs keep the system secure."

DAOs, in particular, have the opportunity to benefit from these principles and their corresponding protocols because they allow for interactions and assurances previously only possible with in-person organizing. By allowing DAOs to move beyond protocolary design, we can bring the social contexts of community into digital governance.",
            "We see SACs as an infrastructure that equally benefits the individual and the organization. By working to align the mutual goals of those two parties, SACs minimize the effects of conflict while emphasizing its benefits. By creating a container for mediated conflict, communities can safely engage in productive iteration. As communities evolve, individuals can seek out right placement, doing the work that best benefits the community while also being personally fulfilled.",
            "While built from a limited set of base principles, SACs open up many new areas of inquiry and design. Stay tuned for upcoming articles on Soft DAOs, the art of forking, uncapturable carriers, and more."

The  p2p Shipyard  gives developers an easy method for converting their Holochain applications to a diversity of platforms. For the mobile context Holochain is set to its “zero-arc” configuration where mobile nodes don’t have to hold a portion of the DHT like a normal Holochain node would.

You may remember that we replaced Electron with a similar library Tauri a year or two ago, and while it seemed to hold promise, the reality wasn’t as great as expected. The biggest issue was the webview — Tauri uses your OS’ system webview, which might be ancient and out of date with current web standards. This was  causing a lot of debugging headaches  for devs, because they didn’t know which browser their UI needed to target. Electron comes with a recent chromium binary, which means there’s a stable front-end target for you to work with.",

One, Kwaxala, is building financial tools for investing in the environments we want to preserve; and the other, IOEN (the Internet of Energy Network), is connecting global finance to the local renewables that need to be developed. Together, they represent the beginning of a movement for ethical investment and regenerative economics.",

It’s also clear that fossil fuel companies are resistant to this change, and that large solar and wind farms can only be one part of the solution. Small scale local energy production will be a large portion of the global market. Minigrids and Microgrids are emerging as solutions that are more efficient and resilient as they don’t need the massive infrastructure of energy distribution on top of the infrastructure of production. Energy is generated, stored, traded, and used locally.",
            "The pathway to fully clean, tradable energy is not immediate. On the way to full access to clean energy, organizations including large corporations are taking seriously the responsibility to offset their production of carbon emissions. A factory produces a lot of carbon, both from the energy it uses and the industrial processes themselves. They can get their electricity from renewable sources, but depending on where a particular factory is and when they are operating, they might not have access to renewables. Renewable energy generation is subject to location, geography, and access to resources like wind, enough sunshine, and the ability to store electricity.",
            "But, just because they are incapable of directly using renewable energy doesn’t mean that they cannot support the use of renewables generally. Environmental Attribute Credits (EACs), including carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), help create incentives to invest, support, and use renewable energy.",
            "Currently, large renewable energy farms can sell carbon credits or RECs (depending on the system used), helping corporations offset their carbon emissions. But these are economies of scale. The accounting needed to get government issuance of these carbon credits only works at large scales (a single electrical meter is a lot easier to measure and monitor than many distributed meters).  IOEN is providing a way for small scale energy producers who serve their local communities to aggregate their energy production and access global renewable certificate markets.",
            "In order to ensure auditability and to account for distributed energy production by a collection of small holders, data is needed to track energy production. IOEN’s current work with partners in Asia is helping companies and home owners provide two types of data. First, photos of their solar arrays, preferably at the time of installation. Secondly, ongoing readings from their meter, showing the energy that they feed back to their local grid. IOEN’s partners then add satellite data which is used to confirm the installation of solar panels at the sites claimed. All of this data becomes available to regulators who can cross reference each source, ensuring that the meter readings match the expected generation range for the panels.",
            "Aggregating the data of many individual producers allows IOEN to meet the scale requirements to work with government regulators, procuring and then selling the certificates to corporations. As each individual energy producer’s contributions to this larger pool is tracked, they are able to then be compensated directly in relation to the amount of energy they produced.",
            "Key to IOEN’s value in the market is the ability for clients to store the data (meter data, photographs etc.) in private networks hosted on Holochain which provides auditors with assurance that the certificates minted are validated and true. This creates transparency and integrity in the certificate. IOEN’s blockchain solutions that sit on top of that data then allow secondary markets to emerge, along with fractionalised investment opportunities in these renewable assets, creating liquidity. Because transactions are all tracked on the blockchain, and linked to secure data in Holochain, different organizations involved in the assets all can be paid seamlessly and transparently through fractionalised payments. Already small businesses, communities, and large corporations are seeing the value in this approach for a number of energy-related environmental assets."

And the question is: how can we invest in that value? Kwaxala is making that a possibility. Most land used for logging, oil drilling and fracking, and other resource extraction is government owned and often in contradiction with recognised Indigenous land rights in the area. Companies own or buy the permits and right to extract resources from that land, without buying the land itself.  Kwaxala is working to buy those same rights, but rather than using them for extraction, they are securing the right to protect and regenerate the ecosystems threatened by extraction.  This legal guarantee of preservation, in an area previously at genuine threat of extraction, is then used to generate carbon offsets each year which can be sold to corporations meeting their net zero commitments.",
            "Kwaxala offsets not only represent sequestered carbon, but also a wider range of monetized ecoservices such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem preservation alongside positive social outcomes such as Indigenous equity and reconciliation. This enables them to command a premium market price per tonne. Additionally, by enabling capital investment directly into the organization holding the right to regenerate, they provide a new way for investment funds to flow into the asset value of the protected natural ecosystem, generating much needed upfront capital to establish these protected areas and counterbalance the extractive economic pressure to destroy the area.",
            "But how do we ensure that the land is well taken care of? Here Kwaxala is using overlapping datasets to build a picture of the ecosystem and its health. Working with Indigenous land stewards, who are also the principal shareholders in Kwaxala itself, they are developing the metrics needed to monitor and support the wellbeing of the particular ecosystems. For some situations, that might be the water and air quality; for others, it might be the presence of indicator species; for many,  it will be the conglomeration of multiple data points, collaborating to tell a story.  This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.",
            "To collect, manage, and maintain this data — and to share it with community members, government regulators, and investors — they are investigating the development of a distributed platform, built on Holochain. Building on Holochain in this case ensures that control of the data isn’t managed solely by the organization claiming to be protecting the ecosystem, but is rather distributed between all stakeholders. With data provenance baked in, it is also easy to track exactly what agent adds any particular piece of data. This combination of verification and distributed storage of overlapping datasets allows for a high degree of trust to be developed, and holds the organization itself accountable."

When something happens, like when two companies trade goods, traditional accounting quickly turns it into simple numbers and accounts, stripping away the context and rich data of the transaction. It doesn't keep all the important details.",

            "In REA, instead of just writing down numbers, accountants keep track of all the important stuff. They look at the resources being traded, the events happening, and the people or companies involved. It's like writing a detailed story that doesn't leave anything out. \"I found a new way of [telling economic stories] using Entity Relationship modeling, and later other things, that was called R E A, because “R” means the two resources that they were going to swap; “A” means to two agents who are at arm's length with each other; and “E” very simply means the process of sending things across this way.\" Professor McCarthy explains.",
            "With REA, it's easier to see how things are connected. For example, if a company sells something, REA would keep track of what was sold, who bought it, and how it affects things like inventory and contracts. This gives a clearer picture of the economy. Imagine a visual story… \"You have a customer called Charlie who will make a sale of inventory. And we put an object into the system, and it's described as a sale or shipment,\" Professor McCarthy elaborates.",

By tracking the flow of resources, events, and agents across a supply chain, REA provides a more comprehensive picture of a company’s environmental and social impact. \"The best example I've seen of the supply chain example is Lynn Foster's examples for an apple pie,\" Professor McCarthy says, referring to a  case study  on the Valueflows  website .",
            "Traditional accounting makes it hard to see how business actions affect the environment, discounting “externalities”. But REA keeps track of important details that show the full impact.",
            "Additionally, professor McCarthy believes that REA accounting is becoming increasingly important as customers and regulators demand more information about how products are made. People want detailed information about the origin and processing of the products they buy, from the farming and dyeing of cotton to the processing of olive oil. They want assurances about the absence of certain chemicals in the soil and the testing done at various stages of production.",
            "It’s this demand for transparency driven by a growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts of business that has customers shifting to companies which are optimizing for sustainability rather than profit.",
            "In response to these concerns, we are seeing changes in regulations, particularly in the EU and North America, that require companies to provide more detailed information about their supply chains. REA accounting is well-suited to meet these requirements because it allows for the flow of contextualized data, not just numbers on ledgers.",

            "The current economic system primarily focuses on removing resources from the earth — creating a world that often overlooks the value of living nature.",
            "As Pete Corke explains, \"Living nature isn't represented in [our economy]. It's all dead and extracted from nature. And in fact, the only way of creating value-flows from the current system into protected nature is by literally burning the transactional medium, burning money through philanthropy.\"",
            "In other words, the current economic system only recognizes the value of nature when it is extracted and sold, and the only way to direct money towards conservation is through philanthropic donations, which do not generate any economic returns or retain asset value.",
            "This approach has led to a lack of ways to recognize the value of ecosystems and the services they provide. Remote communities, like those in British Columbia, Canada, face a tough choice between participating in the resource extraction that makes up most of the local economy or supporting conservation efforts that often lack economic incentives.",
            "Additionally, the established laws and structures around land use are deeply rooted in this resource-focused economic system, making it difficult to create change. So how can one aim to operate within the current structure and transform the economics?",
            "Pete emphasizes that \"Traditional conservation makes British Columbia poorer. It's giving up tax revenues, it's giving up export revenues. And that's at a provincial level. At a local level, they're giving up jobs in remote communities.\"",
            "The extractive industry's control over these structures poses a significant challenge to those seeking to create a regenerative economic system. As Pete points out, \"It's not about replacing extractive economics. It's about creating an  economic  counterbalance to it.\"",
            "Achieving this balance requires not only developing new economic models but also navigating complex laws and governance frameworks that have long prioritized resource extraction over regeneration."

          "content": [
            "Despite the challenges posed by the current extractive economic system, there are significant opportunities for regenerative economics to create a counterbalance. Specifically, regenerative economics would be creating incentive-based conservation efforts that spur economic growth while protecting nature.",
            "As Pete Corke explains, \"The whole point of the regenerative economics space is, hey, we need a two polled [economic] world here to create a counterbalance.\"",
            "One key opportunity lies in generating value flows to conserve natural areas and the local communities that support these ecosystems. Pete emphasizes the importance of creating \"an economic activity that's based on regeneration [which] counteracts extractive economic value.\"",
            "Kwaxala  is building a global network of protected forest areas that, at scale, generate economic markets for natural systems. Their projects demonstrate on-going returns for both forest communities and mindful investors.",
            "Most resource extraction happens on public lands, with companies buying the rights (to log, mine, or drill for oil) that give them use of that land. By buying these rights and safeguarding them, managing the land appropriately, and documenting the revitalization of these ecosystems, it’s possible to demonstrate the value of conservation in a global market.",
            "These thriving ecosystems provide numerous benefits to the people, industries, and municipalities who interact with them. They clean the air and water, offer mental health benefits to individuals, provide educational opportunities and recreational spaces for children, and attract tourism to communities.",
            "This only scratches the surface of the economic and social benefits of rich, site specific ecosystems, on both local and global levels, but we don’t have great ways to account for these benefits within our economy. One market tool is high quality carbon credits, which can be produced through the act of conservation to start accounting for these benefits.",
            "By developing mechanisms that allow individuals and businesses to invest in and hold value in living natural assets, regenerative economics can provide a viable alternative to extractive industries. Whilst carbon offsets and biodiversity credits represent an economic mechanism for recognising the services provided by nature, there are very few mechanisms that enable you to hold equity/investment value in the supply side of that value flow. But that is changing and Kwaxala is leading in that space."

            "These technologies also allow transparent value redistribution back into the communities on the ground, ensuring that the regenerative economy is built from the foundations up in a far more equitable way than the extractive/colonial economy ever was.",
            "Ultimately, the success of regenerative economics hinges on shifting mindsets and creating a new paradigm that recognizes the inherent value of nature. As Pete states, \"Nature doesn't just need a seat at the economic table, we need to acknowledge that it is the table and it's also the air in the room! The human economic system is a subsidiary of the natural economic system.\"",
            "As the world faces mounting environmental challenges, the need for a regenerative economic system has never been more pressing. Pete Corke and Kwaxala's work in partnering with Indigenous communities, protecting at-risk forests, and generating regenerative returns through innovative financial mechanisms that allow anybody to hold equity value in a living forest serves as a powerful example of how we can begin to create a true counterbalance to the extractive economy.",
            "By leveraging Web3 tools such as Holochain, regenerative projects can create a trustworthy data layer that ensures transparency and trust in regenerative economic systems. Holochain's architecture allows for the distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data, essential for documenting ecosystem interactions and ensuring the integrity of regenerative assets.",
            "Centralized solutions have often proved untrustworthy, with instances of carbon credit markets failing to deliver on their promises due to lack of oversight and accountability. These examples highlight the need for trustable solutions that provide transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof records of regenerative assets and their associated impacts. Holochain's distributed data layer creates a system resistant to manipulation and greenwashing, ensuring the value generated by regenerative economics is genuine and long-lasting.",
            "Recognizing the intrinsic worth of healthy ecosystems can create a new economic paradigm that prioritizes the well-being of both human communities and the natural world. The path forward requires collaboration, innovation, and a willingness to challenge entrenched structures."

            "Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.",
            "The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.",
            "In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. \"I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together,\" Spies explains.",
            "Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions."

Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.",

            "Before modern technology, or really before the development of written language, communication was generally transmitted by unenclosable carrier. Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.",
            "The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.",
            "And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast.  The ability to control the carrier results in the ability to control the message."

You  can  stop someone from speaking up around a fire if you physically attack them or try to shout over them. But then everyone knows you’re doing that, which means that your actions are subject to whatever social feedback mechanisms exist to temper abuses of power. So, really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is  covert  power. The manager filtering the suggestion box; the allocation of FM bandwidth to someone over someone else; the private understandings between interest groups and politicians."

In newsprint and on television, it’s the advertisers, as well as executives who are bound to the interests of boards and shareholders, who exert (largely unseen) control over the content we receive. Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.",
            "And of course we have the internet, which has given us a taste of radical participation and democratized access to information, but whose filters on access and information have begun to cause increasing alarm. There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote. And, of course, Google steers you to some web sites over others, according to its secret algorithms.",
            "Our ability to coordinate activity at scale has never been greater, but that coordination is also subject to centralized control and corruption like never before — and really to an unknown degree, because it is largely covert.

If you’re a participant in this ecosystem, you might be thinking that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, at least the ‘best’ ones, are precisely the antidote to the problem of carrier enclosability.",
            "It’s true that blockchain applications have, in many cases at least, offered an exciting means of collaborating outside the reach of outsized government and corporate middlemen. But how unenclosable are they really? Blockchain protocols all rely on some mechanism of  global consensus  to determine which transactions are considered legitimate enough to be added to the shared record. This means that many  nodes  – computers on a given network – must agree with one another before officially adopting any information, then storing it as a  global state , meaning that all nodes hold  all  the same data. It’s an understandable approach: replicating data globally might seem like the only way to coordinate at scale without being subject to centralized authority or being susceptible to data-tampering.",
            "One problem with this approach, though, is that global consensus mechanisms turn out to be a form of carrier enclosure, since they necessarily give power to some people over others to determine the legitimacy of transactions. Ordinary users like you and me do not write directly to the blockchain, nor do we participate in the consensus mechanism that results in data being written to the blockchain. We defer to miners and stakers do those things on our behalf, and in doing so we turn over our authority to them to say what’s written to the record.",
            "What’s more, not all miners and stakers have equal power. In proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, those who own more computing resources have more say. In proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which have become more popular in recent years, those who put up more money as betting stakes have more say. The more computing resources or the more betting stakes you own, the more money you make, which earns you the ability to buy more of those things. Thus, both protocols have a rich-get-richer effect and converge toward greater and greater consolidation of wealth and power over time.",
            "Even  more  carrier enclosure has resulted from blockchain’s attempts to  solve  its efficiency problems. It turns out that achieving global consensus and managing global state require a tremendous amount of processing power and storage capacity, resulting in wait times and fees for every transaction, as well as  posing an obstacle to blockchain’s ability to scale to the needs of real-world challenges . Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions channel control through an increasingly narrow club of authorized representatives who are empowered to accept (or refuse) our transaction.",
            "And real communication enclosures can happen and  have  happened in blockchain projects. The  Ethereum hard fork in 2016 , right-minded as it may have been, was a means of invalidating transactions that had occurred. EOS has also  reversed transactions , as has  Bitcoin Cash .",
            "So, even though the very intention of many blockchain projects is to address intermediation and the centralization of power, they are actually subject to the same kinds of power imbalances we see in other mediums. It’s a tilted playing field, and even a slightly tilted playing field results in a  self-reinforcing feedback loop  that eventually leads to massive wealth imbalances – which is a fair narrative for what’s happened in economies around the world over the course of the last 500 years.",
            "So we’re back to our original question: is it possible to have a system of communicating and transacting that 1) is truly unenclosable and 2) is capable of massive scale?"

          "content": [
            "In considering how a communication system might be both unenclosable and scalable, let’s look at the evolution of language itself. How does language arise? Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.",
            "So, a new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself. We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.",
            "This does  not  mean an absence of rules. Protocols are essential within any given space for filtering signal from noise, and to avoid the gaming of that space. People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.",
            "So, one key ingredient in making any system fundamentally unenclosable is  free association: the ability for anyone to create segmented spaces that people can join or not , with rulesets that are particular to those spaces. An unenclosable version of Wikipedia would be free of the centralized servers that host the data today, but it would still have protocols that say how articles are written. An unenclosable version of Twitter would still have a character limit. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to be able to post a tweet on Wikipedia or an encyclopedic article on Twitter. Within the scope of each app, people are free to express themselves according to the parameters they opted into when joining the app.",
            "Many apps will even need to have centralized aspects of control, such as moderation by individuals or groups. But if the underlying  carrier system  is unenclosable, everyone owns and controls their own data (versus having it held in centralized or third-party enclosure points), so everyone always has the option of leaving the application space for any reason, including if they don’t like some new rule or the way the space is being moderated.",
            "Which leads us to another fundamental aspect of an unenclosable system:  forkability, which is the freedom for anyone to spin up alternative application spaces,  based on the same (or similar) source codes and rulesets, and invite people to the new version. For true forkability, users need to be able to migrate easily between versions, taking their data from one version — such as their complete activity history on a social network or search engine — and load it into the new version. This is, of course, very much not the case with the likes of today’s Facebook and Google, who own and control your data, making only a fraction of it available to you."

The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off. To return to the island analogy again: if people can move freely between islands, bringing language patterns from one to the other, the dialects that are most suitable to people’s needs will be the ones that thrive and spread."

Wealth and influence can still flow within the application spaces according to patterns mutually agreed to within those spaces: reputation systems, ownership systems, subscriptions, sales, badges, degrees, or whatever else makes sense for the nature of the application. But  no one can gain influence by simply controlling the medium of communication itself.  The work of  holding  and  transferring  the data is distributed among the regular participants within the application, with everyone hosting their own data and sharing a bit of the load of hosting the data published to the network.

This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID.

The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a \"game steward\" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result?

Unlike  disable_clone_cell ,  delete_clone_cell  is a somewhat destructive operation, because it makes it impossible to bring a clone cell and its data back to life (although the data is still technically recoverable if you know how to open up the database). That’s why it’s never been part of the app API where any old client could access it. These new HDK functions, by contrast, can only operate on the hApp that the calling cell lives in. We’re working on locking down the app API so only clients authorised to access an app can actually access it, which means we could safely make  delete_clone_cell  available to clients, but in the meantime this gives you a way to securely clean up cells once they’re no longer needed.",

            "The other big news is that  we’ve  cleaned up  the WebSocket code , so the app and admin APIs should have fewer bugs such as dropped connections (particularly when the conductor hits 100% CPU consumption). This does result in  breaking changes , but only if you’re writing a Rust-based app that consumes the  holochain_websocket  crate directly. Anyone who calls the conductor APIs instead (which is most of you, including those who use the officially supported JavaScript and Rust clients) won’t be affected.

In a similar way, the Weave is a formal specification that overlays a set of design principles to make Holochain more accessible for devs building social tools.",

I can also point to some specific external events, like the crypto crash of 2019, which required us to do a big restructuring that took quite a while to integrate and recover from. And of course there’s the well known experience of software projects taking way longer than developers imagine they will, in part because it’s just so hard to know how hard something is, and also because there’s scope creep. We have this tendency to make it harder as we go along because we see things that we missed.  But identifying a single factor to act as scape-goat would hide the real story here."

A fertilized egg grows exponentially for a time and then slows down dramatically before alternating phases of fast and slow growth. Seeds planted in hospitable soil can spend quite some time in germination, then suddenly grow rapidly to sprout above ground, but then seemingly stop growing above ground while underground root systems are spreading like crazy, only to then have the above ground portion explode into exponential growth again before slowing.",
            "What I have learned is that a startup, especially one building such a core-level infrastructure, can be much the same as those seeds. There were points of hidden growth in our project, where it didn’t look like we were getting anywhere in the code, but what was really happening was internal reconfiguration and maturing of the organization itself. And then there were moments where tons of code was being committed, and it really looked like things were on fire, but that might have been from just one team and not integrated with other teams' work.  Seeds take time to germinate, and projects like this twist and bend as they reach for light and water.",

But what constitutes viability!? You could say that viability is when the tool you are delivering creates enough value that a person (or some number of people related to your business model) will use it despite whatever things they don’t like about it. That’s well and good for a simple product,  but what about an infrastructure platform, where you are delivering to developers who themselves have to deliver to end-users?  There is a double viability requirement in that. The developers have to experience the value in the platform to use it despite any flaws, and then the end-users have to do the same again. And I’m guessing this is not merely additive, but at least multiplies the challenge or even causes exponential difficulty!",

Our run-time for end-users has supported Linux, Mac and Windows for over a year, but adding this same support for developers turned out to have been really difficult to deliver. After years of really only supporting development on Linux, with Beta 0.1.0 developers can now develop Holochain apps on their platform of choice: Linux, Mac (Intel & M1), and Windows (under WSL2). We spent hundreds of hours developing and redeveloping our CI tooling such that when a Holochain-core team dev merges a branch, our test suite runs across all the platforms; and when we deploy a new version, binaries are automatically compiled and added to our package management system so that developers can easily pull them to in their dev environment of choice.",
            "A much more difficult place to meet developers where they are has to do with the nature of Holochain itself as a distributed application development platform.  The core value that Holochain delivers, distributed applications that don’t rely on any centralized architecture, actually requires developers to think and do things a little differently than they might be used to.  This means that there’s a learning curve, and so getting started can take some effort. To address this, for Beta 0.1.0 we have delivered what I can only describe as a stellar scaffolding framework.  Our scaffolding tool allows developers to generate the bones of a fully functional hApp in minutes.  But, again, in our commitment to meeting developers where they are, the scaffolding tool allows you to pick which UI framework you want to use (currently Svelte, Lit, or Vue). Additionally because the scaffolding tool is modular and extensible, advanced developers can create more scaffolding templates that support more UI frameworks or even different types of projects."

I believe that the tools we use on a daily basis aren’t just functional. Our use of them touches into all kinds of aspects of our being, our identity and our sense of aesthetics.  From my own experience, at least some part of my willingness to try something new is just that it feels right. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to match  my  preferred style, it’s almost more that I can recognize that enough care was put into the tool that it actually has  its own  style. It’s as if in this realm,  what matters happens at the level of recognizing attention to detail.",

Similarly we’ve done lot’s of “pixel pushing” on both the Launcher and our sample hApps (TalkingStickies and KanDo!), so that they look good as well as being really usable and thus deliver a strong end-user experience. The DevHub for uploading hApps is working pretty darn well. The scaffolding’s command-line UX was tested over and over. Even internally in the Holochain’s HDK we spent months working on improving dev ergonomics, i.e. ensuring that it is easy and clear to make Holochain calls from within your DNAs.",

The lens of how things feel to use, and what thresholds actually matter when developing a project like this. Clearly we will use things that are really clunky if the value of use is great enough.  So minimum-viability is relative. But my sense is that we’ve crossed over a threshold.",

Here  our  data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking.

Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour  in  the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality.

Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see  Holochain’s validation rules ).  In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point.  Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see  Holochain’s DHT ), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers."

Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others  by design , it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments.

The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.",

This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data."

By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality.

A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data,  allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks.  These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the  opacity  of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data.

It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem.  To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory ( IIT ).",

Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another.  The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.",

By analogizing Φ in  IIT  to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.",

These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data.  Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent.  Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.",

By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS."

The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.",

            "Last year I learned  about the success of  Digital Democracy  and  Āhau , two groups building tools for indigenous people around the world to map the wealth in their ecosystems and cultures and use the collected data to preserve their sovereignty — even to the point of  winning cases in federal courts .",
            "This year, however, I heard fewer new success stories and more passionate calls for working tools. The message from activists and change-makers was clear and very loud:  They need what we’re building, they need it to work, and they need it yesterday.  We were confronted with stories from people working to support the  survival of their people , stories from people striving to  preserve bodily autonomy and gender-affirming care , stories from people trying to keep the lights on when infrastructure failed. The traditional web can’t serve these needs — you can’t deliver a cloud-based solution to people who have no internet, or whose access is policed by oppressive states.",
            "The call was both encouraging and sobering. It showed that  those of us building tools for decentralisation are on the right track , but it also revealed  how much work we have ahead of us .",
            "There’s a gap between creators and practitioners. Many of us are building tools that we  hope  the world needs. We start out ‘scratching our own itch’, reasoning that if we need something, then others must too. And that’s where our genius comes from; our creativity gives birth to new possibilities. But our technology is still young, and we haven’t had a lot of experience  testing  it to see if it is, in fact, what the rest of the world needs.",
            "In many sessions, like a  workshop  that my colleague Collin and I hosted on questioning and testing our design choices, and a discussion circle hosted by  DWeb Labs , we bridged the creator/practitioner divide to face one question together:  how do we make our tech solve real problems?"

            "The main theme I heard was that  the specific tools don’t matter.  What matters is that they work. The appropriate solution for a given context might be as simple as a web service running on a ten-year-old laptop, or even pen and paper, or it might be complex enough to  warrant a blockchain .",
            "In uncovering what this means, I heard a few other themes:",
            "It’s time for developers and designers to unseat themselves as authorities , presenting themselves instead as servants who  honour the wisdom and abilities  of the people they’re designing for. Users are the best experts on what they need, yet the ‘culture of the expert’ undermines that and leaves them feeling disempowered.",
            "One-size-fits-all tools are not necessarily going to work, especially if they embed assumptions that come from a  western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratised  perspective. The key to transforming our design process is  relationship  — meeting the real people we intend to serve, not abstract personas, and learning to listen to them.  Co-design , especially using an agile approach, is a well-established set of practices for sharing the design process.",
            "This will result in culturally appropriate software, tailored to the needs of a specific group. But in our effort to make empowering software accessible to more people (that is, making it affordable to create and access these tools), we may also want to create  ‘generic tools’ for ‘specific cultures’  — tools that, while one-size-fits-all, embed as few assumptions as possible. If we want to do this well, we’ll need to analyze our designs rigorously for cultural blind spots, make our tools as adaptable as possible, and most importantly, partner with real people to test them.",
            "Solve for needs that are regular rather than rare.  Rather than building with an eye toward a once-every-twenty-years type natural disaster, we can focus on creating tools and processes that help address everyday needs. From communication and coordination, to commerce or even play, people have to find a tool useful in their daily lives or they won’t adopt it. By serving everyday needs, we can ensure that these tools are already in use when one of those rare events inevitably comes along.",
            "Build for surprise and delight.  Similarly, if we build something that is all function, but isn't simple, easy, and effective in addressing the issue at hand, then people aren't going to use it. Like much of the open source software space, those of us developing distributed solutions need to get more disciplined about designing for ease of use.",
            "I think there’s something unique in local-first tech that could actually surpass the user experience of cloud software. It makes apps ‘just work’ in ways that are challenging for the cloud to match — most DWeb stacks already give users offline mode and inbuilt privacy while making automatic scaling easy and low-cost for developers. Our next step is to close gaps that make the experience unfamiliar, complicated, and buggy. Adoption happens when the first experience is rewarding.",
            "Better solutions are discovered when tool-makers cooperate with each other.  We need a humility that’s courageous enough to step back when someone else’s tool is more appropriate for the job — even (or especially) if that tool is not digital. Rather than fix-alls, let’s see our projects (and distributed tech as a whole) as layers in a stack which shifts from use case to use case. By building greater interoperability between our tools, we can occupy ecological niches that are mutually supportive of each other. Protocol-agnostic approaches like those used by  ADAM  — which allow users to enjoy a unified experience bridging between spaces and tools — can help us leverage the richness of our ecosystem.",
            "I was encouraged to see creators and practitioners forming coalitions; DWeb Labs was the most prominent of these. It consists of people who have separately been applying DWeb tech to big problems for years, so it’s wonderful to see them combining their experience and demonstrating the mutual respect that allows them to find the best solutions rather than compete for primacy.",
            "There are new territories to explore.  The DWeb community has long been about simply building alternative systems in the shadow of the dominant systems. There’s a subtly anarchic do-it-ourselves streak here; we prefer to “build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete”, in R Buckminster Fuller’s famous  words , rather than fighting against big, top-heavy structures.",
            "This DWeb Camp, I heard more people talking about dancing strategically with those structures. On a mere pragmatic level, governments and large corporations are the world’s biggest buyers of software, and sages like  Mei Lin Fung  encouraged us to consider how we could impact people’s lives if we got these institutions to adopt our tech.",
            "There’s also room for us to start influencing public policy, educating lawmakers about the fact that the DWeb is not just a place where nasty characters hang out but can actually empower citizens in ways that align with the values these officials claim to uphold. And when the DWeb community cooperates on this, our unified voice will carry more weight.",
            "We can never fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices , but we can speculate intelligently about them, uncover our assumptions, identify the gaps in our knowledge, and become curious enough to explore and close those gaps. And as we build up a community of practice with its own ‘ pattern languages ’ — libraries of interconnected design solutions that are proven through experience to work (or not work) for given contexts — the unknown will give way to a body of best practices, and our design interventions will become progressively more life-giving and less damaging to the people we serve.",
            "A number of us are  creating  pattern languages together for various aspects of DWeb design, ranging from online communities to cryptographic protocols.  Join us on the DWeb Discord server  if that sort of thing gets you excited!"

Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.",

            "tl;dr: While Holochain 0.2 is working just fine for hApps used by small groups of people, we’re seeing bottlenecks when networks and their data loads grow. We’re nearing a stable 0.2.2 release which tackles some of the biggest performance issues, but further improvements will still come after that point.",
            "As a developer, you’ve probably had the experience of polishing up your application, running it through CI tests one more time (all green!), cutting a release, and… getting a bug report from someone who hit some obscure corner of your code or tried to use it in OS or networking conditions you’d never dreamed of. Even the most well-tested code is vulnerable to the kind of creative challenges the real world likes to throw at it.",
            "Holochain’s CI test suite has checks for performance regressions — it generally has to pass a certain level of responsiveness before a release can be cut. These tests exercise the conductor fairly aggressively. Even still, when we released it to the world, it struggled to keep up with real-world usage scenarios, as my colleague  Eric wrote about recently .",
            "Why did this happen? Simple: the real world is messy. It’s hard to write tests that anticipate the issues you’ll see out there. Many of them will be ‘ black swans ’ — situations that are inherently impossible to predict. For example, our automated tests didn’t anticipate the performance issues that could happen when network communication is thin and unreliable.",
            "And that, of course, is exactly the kind of situation you encounter in the real world. It turned out that, in large networks with lots of data, network latency and bandwidth caused gossip bottlenecks at unexpected moments. Aborted and restarted gossip sessions were creating race conditions, causing network connection pool saturations that took a while to clear out.",
            "So of course the core devs are tackling these specific bottlenecks. But they’re also building their capacity to respond to future issues of this kind. You can’t predict the next black swan, but you can work on your ability to respond to the unexpected. This is happening in two ways:",

The task now is to make it right — which is not about fixing fundamental defects but instead refactoring the code to make it easier to test.",
            "And that in turn will allow us to make it fast. Holochain is a framework for building everyday apps that serve real human needs through good times and bad. In order to do this, it needs to feel good to use.  In ideal situations Holochain already feels fast enough — we’ve already been using hApps like  Acorn ,  KanDo , and  TalkingStickies  for months in our daily work.  Now it’s time to make it work well in all those non-ideal situations.",
            "The core devs have already made a lot of progress. We’re anticipating a release of 0.2.2 soon, which we’ll declare the next stable release after 0.1.6. It will include fixes for a zome call timeout issue, along with various improvements they’ve already made to the networking layer. The first release candidate is  already cut , and our next step is to stress-test it with a few flagship apps before deciding if it’s ready. 0.2.2 won’t fix all possible performance issues, but it will be an incremental-yet-noticeable improvement.",

            "A complete primer on Holochain and blockchain would need a good deal of detail about what blockchain really is and how it works, and we’d probably be addressing a lot of common technical misconceptions about blockchain in the process. This is not that article.",
            "Instead, this piece focuses on the  approach  each technology takes to solving an important challenge, which is really  the fundamental challenge of decentralized computing: how to ensure that data is accurate and tamper-proof in a way that is efficient enough to scale.",

          "header": "Blockchain and Global Consensus",
          "content": [
            "Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, decentralized ledger of data. You can think of a blockchain as a record of events: the things people said, who agreed to what, who sent money to whom, and so on. Up until blockchain was invented, these sorts of records were pretty much always stored in centralized databases, such as those held by government entities or private companies. Blockchain was created as a way for people to interact and transact without needing to trust such intermediaries.",
            "What makes blockchain secure and trustable – in other words, what ensures its  data integrity  – is that the data is not just cryptographically protected but also replicated to many different computers (called nodes) controlled by different people or organizations. Only when a piece of data is adopted by the multitude of nodes is it considered factual, at which point it’s committed to the record. For someone to alter the record, they would have to not only break cryptographic barriers but also change most of the copies that are floating out there – a pretty much impossible task.",
            "The way that nodes reach ‘consensus’ on what data to commit to the record varies from blockchain to blockchain, but it typically involves some type of competition among the nodes to write the next chunk of entries, or ‘block’, to the chain. Ultimately the selection of the winning node is random, so it’s not exactly consensus in the way that people mean the term in the real world. But the important takeaway is that, one way or another,  the blockchain nodes come to terms on a  global state  of data, where all nodes hold a replica of  all the same data .",
            "And so here we come to the scalability problem: it requires tremendous computing work for all the nodes to write and hold the same data. This makes blockchains notoriously slow processors: the Bitcoin network processes just a few transactions per second, while the Ethereum network currently processes dozens. Users are accustomed to waiting minutes, sometimes up to an hour, for a single transaction to be confirmed.",
            "The problem gets worse as you try to make blockchain do more things, which has been its aspiration, more or less, since Ethereum positioned itself as a decentralized world computer when it launched in 2014. That’s the point at which blockchains began to be able to store not just transaction records but all kinds of files and even executable application code that performs functions when accessed, resulting in new data that also gets written to the blockchain. It’s been an attractive idea to imagine that much of what we do on the web today could be hosted on blockchain networks as decentralized applications (dApps). In reality, though, apps like social networks, communication platforms, travel-booking systems, ride-sharing systems, calendar systems, and so on need much faster throughput, by many orders of magnitude, than blockchain can provide. Can you imagine waiting several minutes (and paying a gas fee!) to get a message through on a chat platform? Or for an edit to show up on a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs? Can you imagine how much computation and storage would be required to accommodate on a blockchain all of the photos and videos on social media, with all nodes needing to write all of that data and keep it forever? It doesn’t work. Facebook receives  over 4 million likes  every minute  and currently stores  over  250 billion  photos .",
            "Efficiency is such a challenge in blockchain that there are entire companies, including some of the most talked-about crypto projects today, dedicated to figuring out how to make blockchain scale better. Some of them focus on ‘layer-1’ solutions, which attempt to increase the throughput of blockchain protocols themselves, while others are ‘layer-2’, which perform computations or store data off-chain and then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Most of these solutions, though, seem to be setting their sights on low-throughput applications such as financial transacting as opposed to live collaboration apps, social networks, media platforms, and so on. And the few that do seem capable of handling a broader set of applications make compromises on decentralization, concentrating hosting and consensus mechanisms among centrally authorized nodes.",
            "Still, the accomplishment of blockchain is not to be taken lightly. It’s more resilient to corruption than any ledgering or value-storage system than has ever existed before, and it is changing global finance as a result, with lots of room for growth still. But what’s probably even more important is the awareness it has sparked of what’s possible. Its aspirations have infected broad communities of people with a sense that we  could  communicate and transact without centralized intermediaries. Blockchain’s scalability challenges may ultimately limit its utility, but it has already revolutionized how humans think about interacting."

If everyone could just host themselves rather than relying on mining nodes to do it? We could avoid all this massive replication, which would obviously be much more efficient. We would just need to do it in a way that still ensures data integrity. We would have to be completely confident that, as everyone represents their own data to the network, there is no way for people to  mis represent their data.",

            "We’ll get to some of the mechanics that make this possible in a moment. First, let’s look at the principles  behind  the mechanics, by way of analogy to nature… starting with some of its smallest objects.",
            "Consider the covalent bonding of a chlorine atom and a hydrogen atom to create a molecule of hydrogen chloride. This requires the hydrogen atom to have a free electron available, i.e. not shared with any other atom. How does the chlorine atom ‘know’ whether the hydrogen atom has an electron available? It’s simply apparent. The hydrogen atom  embodies  whether a free electron exists in its state. It’s not able to misrepresent whether there’s a free electron, and it’s not able to ‘double-spend’ its electron, because the availability of an electron is evident to other relevant atoms upon inspection. There is  global visibility, on demand, of local state.",
            "It would be ridiculous to believe that, in order to know whether an atom has a free electron, there should be a global, synchronized ledger of the whereabouts of all electrons in the universe. Or – to use a natural example with somewhat larger objects – that the status of the trillions of cells in our bodies should be registered on a global body tracking system. The cells already embody the changes: the levels of oxygen in the blood cells, for example, determine whether they offer oxygen to organ tissue cells in exchange for carbon dioxide. Then the reverse happens once the blood cells reach the lungs, where they exchange carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen. These interactions are determined on a cell-to-cell basis, without reference to any body-wide ledger of blood cell oxygen levels.",
            "Holochain’s premise is that it’s equally unnecessary for all nodes in a decentralized application to hold a record of everyone’s state, as happens in blockchain, or for nodes to reach consensus before a user commits a state change to their own record.  The local embodiment of state can act as its own authority, as long as the structure of data is tamper-proof.  Also, only information necessary for larger-scale coordination needs to be widely shared, with all shared data strongly tied to where it came from. In this way, Holochain is an  agent-centric system  for decentralized computing: the users (agents) themselves are the definitive source of information in the system.",

Hashes are unique to the particular data they represent: changing just one comma to a period in a thousand-page book would result in a completely different hash.",
            "DHT.  Data that needs to be shared with the network is published to a shared environment called a  distributed hash table , or DHT . Your tweets and comments in a Twitter-like app, your ride requests in an Uber-like app, your edits in a collaborative document editor… all of these are on the DHT. (Data that doesn’t need to be shared can remain private to your source chain.)  Each user running a Holochain app stores a tiny slice of the app’s DHT, in addition to hosting their own data.",
            "DNA.  Each application’s rules for sharing data are written into the application code itself, known as DNA.  The DNA is what says that this is an application for tweeting (which involves sharing data with a certain structure) versus calling rides or co-editing documents (which involve sharing different data with different structures). It also defines who can join the app’s network: can anyone join, do you need an invitation code or to pay, or is there some other criteria?   A copy of the DNA is hosted by every application user, which means that  any user is able to validate whether data being shared to their slice of the DHT conforms to the application’s rules."

Some of these entries might have been published to the DHT and others might not have, but  in all cases the headers, which contain the hashes of the entries,  are  shared to the DHT . In other words, I may or may not have published the  contents  of a given diary page, but everyone is able to see that I wrote  something  on the page, and they are able to see the unique fingerprint that corresponds the contents of the page (which would completely change if I were to ever modify the contents even slightly).",
            "Let’s say you and I are doing some transaction such that I need to send you 250 units. The app’s rules (encoded in the DNA) will say that in order for this transaction to go through, you need to verify my account balance, which means that I need to show you enough information from my diary in order for you to do so. (Remember, there is  global visibility of local state , to whatever degree is necessary for a given action to be validated.) Your computer can very quickly add up all the pluses and minuses on the pages in my transaction diary, my source chain. You know that I’m not hiding any pages because you can check the DHT and see exactly how many pages have writing on them. And there’s no way I could have altered a previous page without making it obvious I’ve done so, because every action I take is a new timestamped event with a new header and new unique hash that also gets shared to the DHT. Plus a system of header monitoring by ‘neighbors’ ensures that I’m unable to fork or roll back my source chain without getting flagged. If anything doesn’t add up, or if it seems like something has been obscured, the transaction simply fails the validation rules and does not take place."

            "There is no need for universal agreement.  Keeping with our currency example for a moment: how many computers need to confirm our transaction in order for it to be executed? If this were blockchain,  all nodes  would need to come to terms with one another and keep a record of our transaction forever. In Holochain, the transaction is complete when  just   two  computers have written it: yours and mine. Then, afterward, we publish the data to the DHT, and randomized groups of nodes store it so that others can confirm for themselves, later as the need arises, that we’re representing our states accurately. Data validation is party-to-party, just like for all the cells in our body, just like for all the atoms in the universe.  This feature alone eliminates all of the computing required to reach global consensus.",
            "There is no need for universal state.  It’s true that many types of data  do  need to be published to the network – tweets and comments, ride requests, document edits, and so on, to keep with our earlier examples. It’s also true that an app sometimes needs system-wide tracking to monitor aspects of overall activity, just as the body has ways of monitoring and responding to changes in blood oxygen levels overall; this is another reason that the DHT often needs to store some amount of shared data. Unlike on a blockchain, though,  each piece of data on the DHT is replicated only enough times to make sure the needed data is always available , including when the author might be offline. We’re talking about maybe dozens of replications in Holochain rather than potentially thousands or more in blockchain. And this limited replication is strategically distributed across  all the users  participating in the app, which means that  each user performs just a little bit of extra work to hold a very small portion of the DHT.",
            "Each DHT contains data for only one application.  A blockchain contains all the data from  all  the applications running on that chain: every Ethereum node, for example, contains all the historical data for all the dApps running on Ethereum.  In Holochain, each app has its  own  shared storage space in the form of its DHT.  As Holochain architect Arthur Brock  put it recently , “If I just want to run a Twitter-like app, why should I also have to run your crypto exchange, gambling app or collectible cartoon animals? On Holochain, users only run the apps they actually  use .”",
            "Each new user to an application adds storage and computing capacity.   In blockchain applications, where miners and stakers write and store data, the network capacity is constant no matter how many nodes are added, so increased user activity increases the strain on computing resources.  Holochain applications are entirely hosted by the users themselves, so as the demand for the app grows, so does the computing power to run it."

Let’s also add in the approach that today’s centralized social networks take, as a point of additional comparison. In this social network, you do all the things you’re accustomed to: posting text and images and videos, commenting on other people’s posts, and chatting privately with friends.",

                "In the  centralized scenarios  common today, all of the data – including your photos and comments and messages – are held by the company who owns the platform. The social network is supposedly secure and scalable by virtue of its being centralized: the company takes responsibility for maintaining the network, and they are paid to do so in one or more ways. As we have seen, though, our data is often not as secure as these companies might like us to believe: data breaches are extremely common (since data stored in one centralized place makes a honeypot for hackers), plus our data is routinely sold to advertisers or leaked to other third parties (the  Cambridge Analytica scandal  was but one extreme example).",
                "A  blockchain version  of a social network would theoretically be hosted by the miners or stakers running the blockchain nodes. Integrity would be ensured by virtue of your data being written to the blockchain only after a consensus of nodes determines the data to be legitimate, then being replicated across all nodes and stored by them forever. But the data load would be extremely high in this scenario, creating a major scalability problem. Many blockchains and blockchain apps try to solve this problem by reducing the number of nodes that need to reach consensus, or by doing much of the computing or hosting work off-chain on centrally authorized servers. These approaches all compromise on decentralization and point us back, in one way or another, toward scenario #1. (In point of fact, even a truly on-chain social network would be only nominally decentralized, since the miners and stakers, who need to be paid to do their job just like a centralized company does, effectively become a new kind of intermediary. But this is the subject of  another article .)",
                "In a Holochain version, the entire network – all of the data and even the application code – is hosted by the users themselves. It’s truly  peer-to-peer . Data integrity is ensured through global visibility of local state, established on an as-needed basis. You share your photos, comments, and messages to the network through a shared table called a distributed hash table (DHT), but you remain the primary authority on everything you’ve published. The network is scalable by the fact that no global consensus is necessary, by the fact that the DHT involves only as much data and replication as necessary, and by the fact that every user shares a small piece of the load. The more users join the network, the more capacity it has for scale. And there are no intermediaries at all – no one who needs to be paid or trusted to write and store your data on your behalf."
              ]
            },
            "If a peer-to-peer approach is that much better, why hasn’t everyone been doing it this way all along? One factor is probably the technical complexity involved, but another is probably that it’s difficult for people to imagine that everyone could host their own data and not be able to misrepresent themselves. Even though Holochain has been around in some form for several years, its approach to data integrity is enough of a departure from blockchain’s that developers and users are only just beginning to understand its potential, similar to how it took several years for Ethereum’s capabilities to be widely understood.",
            "That does seem to be changing, however, especially since Holochain’s  refactored state model went live  and is proving to be many times more performant than previous versions – and also since so many new applications are preparing to launch on Holochain. And we can expect greater and greater awareness of Holochain as more applications go live in the coming months.",
            "At a time when blockchain still has so much potential for growth, it may seem odd to be already talking about a post-blockchain application space. But given the scalability challenges blockchain faces and Holochain’s readiness to leapfrog these issues, it might be time to begin thinking outside the blocks.",

            "Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.",

And so DWeb Camp decided to shut off the connection to the internet for the day and focus on the implementation of peer-to-peer technologies in the real world. Running solely on the local meshnet, Holochain and many other projects brought technologies for people to use in this environment. We want to build things that work out in the real world, with real people, who have actual problems, and so we need tests and challenges that mimic those contexts to get there.",

            "In March 2023 Holochain began conversations with DWeb Camp about sponsorship and offered to create a simple application for note taking and community connection (via a tag cloud and shared space for documentation). This was intended to increase the collective intelligence of the camp and to help document the conference sessions.  As a local-first, peer-to-peer application it would run directly on participants' laptops and connect over the mesh network LAN that the wonderful DWeb network team sets up each year, thus not needing to connect to central servers or the rest of the internet.",
            "At the 2022 DWeb Camp many of us experienced challenges with the scheduling app Sched. Because everyone at camp was connecting to their servers over the same low bandwidth connection, camp participants had ongoing issues loading and accessing the schedule.  These conditions are exactly where distributed applications shine, and we saw this as an opportunity to give people a strong experience of a local-first application."

This day became known as “ Tomorrow ” — a day for stepping into and embodying the technologies and social patterns that the distributed web is building towards.  On that day, access to the wider Internet would be shut off so as to give all of us distributed web tool builders a real opportunity to put our tools where our mouths are!  Furthermore, to double down on decentralization, during this day all the participants would be using our app for proposing sessions and coordinating in which spaces they would go.",
            "This felt like a really exciting opportunity that we couldn’t pass up, but it came with some significant challenges.  The main one being that the app would have to work on cell phones because it just wasn’t going to be feasible to have 400 people toting their laptops around the forests of Camp Navaro just to add in their sessions and browse the schedule. But therein lay the rub: Holochain is not yet cell phone ready. So, to do this, we would actually need to either get it ready for phones, or come up with a work-around that was more like Holo-hosting, where cell phone users could just use a browser to access a Holochain instance through a proxy. But of course we couldn’t use actual Holo-hosting itself because this was all supposed to work on a day where access to the wider internet was off!"

            "We decided to go for both options: As Plan A, we would move forward on our “zero-arc” solution for running Holochain on cell phones directly. This solution disables gossip (and thus gets around the cell phone OS penchant of killing apps that use too much CPU/Memory/Networking), but still allows each person’s source-chain to live on the phone. As a backup, in case we couldn’t get plan A to work in time (we only had a few months), we would also develop a multiplexer, a kind of “Holo-hosting-light,” that would allow browser access to a pool of Holochain conductors that we would run on a cluster of small boxes on-site.  The irony was not lost on us that to get things working in this setting we would have to do a kind of micro-re-centralization of a fully distributed tool,  but this is still a useful configuration of the tech to explore!",
            "So, I did some project planning, initial app prototyping, and smoke testing for our Plan B just to make sure that Holochain could handle the load of 500 people creating sessions and doing all kinds of activities on the 3 conductors in the multiplexer which we thought would be sufficient for our little cluster.  The results looked great, no load problems.  We also had a nice project plan with the various aspects of all the work and our participation in the conference, spreading out the labor and ensuring buy-in across all the stakeholders,  and so we gave the green light to go ahead.",
            "The fantastic  Jordan Gray  took the initial design requirements and created the basic UX layout for the app. From Jordan’s designs, I built out the DNA for the app and Svelte-based single-page-app front-end. We then invested significant time in building this into a reasonably polished user experience with many, many rounds of UX/UI testing and improvements so that the app would really work well for the event and provide a powerful experience both of a distributed app, but also of the distributed coordination of a conference event.  We really wanted to deliver on the ethos of the D in DWeb both at the technical and social levels."

            "For a number of complex reasons, we realized about six weeks before the event that Plan A for mobile wasn’t going to land in time for DWeb. There were too many development steps with too much risk to be able to be sure it would work. Though we had the conductor compiling and working on iOS and Android, some aspects of networking were being blocked, and we realized that there just wasn’t enough time to test, debug, and get the app through the Apple/Google App/Play-Store deployment process. So we switched completely to Plan B which appeared to be working very well. I was able to build the multiplexer in a weekend, which was what we expected because it's a fairly low complexity solution. It’s just a simple Node web app sitting behind a reverse-proxy which does 3 things: 1) installs app instances using people’s keys and passwords as a seed for generating their key-pair, 2) creates a UI credential that gets stored in people’s browser as a cookie, and 3) accepts zome calls from the UI signed using that credential and forwards it to the appropriate conductor.",
            "But then things started to get hairy: as we ran our testing sessions with more and more people, we started to get zome-call timeouts and other symptoms that looked like conductor overload. This was quite surprising as it was happening at levels of interaction well below those we subjected the conductor to in our initial smoke-testing. We soon discovered that this was because users were often just reloading their web-browsers which was dropping in-progress websocket connections to the conductor. Holochain was designed under the assumption of a single user connecting over a few websockets to a local conductor, here we were creating hundreds of unexpected websocket connections. To fix this, we added web-socket connection multiplexing into our multiplexer setup! This improved things, but still, after a while, things stopped working again.  Grrrr.",
            "So then, as we continued to debug these issues, we really started seeing the rise of additional contextual complexity.  Example: our plan for deploying to our cluster using our internal nix infrastructure (based on hydra), was implemented, but incomplete because we discovered that we wouldn’t be able to serve our multiplexer service over plain http because cell phone browsers get grumpy about that and basically require https for decent user experience. So we had to include adding and provisioning ssl certificates to reverse-proxy web-servers. And well, it just snowballed from there…"

Each one took minutes or hours to address. Time and again, we had successful test-runs followed by complete failures.",
            "When we got to DWeb Camp it looked like the app was finally ready, but then this saga continued all throughout the build days, and even into the two days leading up to Saturday’s  Tomorrow  day of emergent sessions.  We did, finally, get it working. Bugs at all levels, from the UI to the network configurations, to Holochain itself, were squashed.  However, by this point, the DWeb conference team had already made the call to use the backup analog process for conference scheduling (which was a more than reasonable decision given the challenges up to that point), but we were still going to use the app for its initial purpose of note-taking and sensemaking. So, there we are with the whole cluster provisioned and hundreds of people starting to use the app when suddenly the power went out to the whole valley. This meant that though peoples’ phones were operating, there was no local LAN to connect to because the Wifi access points were down. It was a perfect example of an unending series of cascading failure modes, and an ideal embodiment of exactly what the  Tomorrow  day was supposed to be a test of:  how fully decentralized can our tech stack be? Not just as we talk about it, but in actual practice, in the middle of a camp in the redwood forest.",
            "On the flip-side, this led to a beautiful experience in further emergence.  We had planned to do a get-your-hands-on-it session for people to experience running various Holochan apps. Well, that actually worked!  Because even though the Wifi access points were down, we had the idea of turning on a cell-phone’s hot-spot functionality which, even without cell service, made it an ad-hoc Wifi router for Holochain nodes on laptops to connect in the middle of the woods with no power!  This felt like a significant real-life demo of the power of local-first distributed computing architecture."

Part of the difficulty of expanding contextual complexity comes precisely from the fact that it is invisible at the outset, even when you account for invisible additional complexity, which we did. We certainly detected and fixed a bunch of subtle performance bugs in Holochain. And we greatly increased our in-house capacity to build out apps with decent user-experience.",
            "One of the most powerful lessons for me, however, was the lived experience of what an amazing team we have assembled.  As each one of the problems we encountered arose, someone jumped forward to help figure it out, or work on it until we moved through to the next challenge.

            "The invitation of DWeb’s “Tomorrow” to take risks and bring technologies to use rather then just talking about them was answered by Holochain and others.  It served as a forcing function to put our tooling and teamwork to the test in a setting where the contextual complexity was quite high. With Holochain in beta, this experience allowed us to squash some very difficult to find bugs. We will continue to prioritize partnerships and projects that put Holochain to the test.  And if anybody is interested in using a very cool app for helping run open-space/unconference style gatherings, please get in touch with us!",
            "Special thanks to Eric Bear (process design, testing, holding the relationship with DWeb), Jordan Gray (initial spec), Aaron Brodeur (UX/UI), David Braden (multiplexer & app stress testing, tooling, and Holochain debugging), Jost Schulte (testing across all levels), Stefan Junker (network infrastructure and nix deployment), Gregory Jensen (Holochain testing and debugging), and the many others who put time and labor into this project. Similarly, thank you to everyone in the Holochain team and community who showed up to the repeated test sessions both before and at DWeb Camp."

In addition to presentations, workshops, and panels, we developed a custom app for the event. We decided to create an app for scheduling and managing emergent sessions across the event. But this app had to work in the woods, and on people’s phones.  In the end, we stumbled and learned.",

In May, community devs  Hedayat Abedijoo and Nick Stebbings showcased a small Holochain application at the Volla community event . Since then we have been in a collaborative process of application design and testing to get Holochain apps running on their privacy-first OS."

We showcased this game at events from  Zebu Live  in London, to  DevConnect  in Istanbul, and we even  hosted our own event  spinning off from  NFT SF  when the conference was sadly put on hold.

This feeling grew stronger over time, and at times, I wondered if my enthusiasm for Holochain might be an exaggeration due to my deep involvement. As a non-technical person, I was concerned that I might have missed something important about it. That is why I wanted to see how others, especially technical experts and policy makers, perceived Holochain when they were learning about its “whys, hows, and whats” at the camp.",
            "It proved to be a bit challenging for them to grasp Holochain because it has a completely different paradigm compared to blockchain. While blockchain is data-centric, Holochain is agent-centric. This means that the users, which include ourselves and our devices, play a central role in a Holochain network. This perspective shift is difficult because it requires adapting to a more distributed and truly peer-to-peer way of managing data and interactions between autonomous agents. Additionally, understanding other aspects of Holo and Holochain such as the mechanism behind HoloFuel, a mutual-credit system backed by hosting power which is a significantly different approach from fiat or Ethereum for example, added another layer of complexity. However, as they started to understand it, I clearly observed the excitement in their eyes.",
            "They became excited because they could envision how this tool/framework enables us to address and solve problems effectively. Therefore, this excitement among technical persons and policy makers was not merely a result of theoretical fascination, but rather a recognition of the practical possibilities and potential solutions that Holochain brings to the table. It sparked a genuine excitement about the transformative impact it could have on our digital sphere and the abilities it offers to individuals and communities in shaping their own destinies."

Despite creating or being involved in an exceptional and potentially disruptive technology framework, the team members and the community exhibited true modesty. This humility was not artificial or some sort of facade; it is an inherent part of their nature, and it likely contributed to their ability to develop Holochain. Inspired by nature, they clearly combine their intelligence with the virtue of humility. They are not driven by a desire to save the world; instead, they passionately work towards building a meaningful tool that can assist people in their daily lives. And quite possibly, their dedicated efforts will ultimately lead to world-changing improvements.",

Bu nedenle kampta Holochain'in \"nedenlerini, nasıllarını ve ne olduğunu\" öğrenirken başkalarının, özellikle de teknik uzmanların ve politika yapıcıların Holochain'i nasıl algıladıklarını görmek istedim.",
            "Holochain'i kavramak onlar için biraz zor oldu çünkü Holochain blokzinciri teknolojisine kıyasla tamamen farklı bir paradigmaya sahip. Blokzinciri veri merkezliyken, Holochain katılımcı (agent) merkezlidir. Bu, bir Holochain ağında bizlerden ve bizim cihazlarımızdan oluşan kullanıcıların merkezî bir rol oynadığı anlamına gelir. Veri merkezli bakış açısından bu bakış açısına geçmek zordur çünkü kendi iradeleriyle hareket eden katılımcılar arasındaki veri ve etkileşimleri yönetmenin daha dağıtık ve gerçek anlamda eşler arasında (P2P) işleyen bir yöntemine uyum sağlamayı gerektirir. Ayrıca, Holo ve Holochain'in, örneğin fiat paralardan ve Ethereum'dan önemli ölçüde farklı bir yaklaşıma sahip olması, barındırma gücüyle desteklenen bir karşılıklı kredi (mutual-credit) sistemi olan HoloFuel'in arkasındaki mekanizma gibi diğer yönlerini anlamak, başka bir karmaşıklık katmanı ekler. Ancak günün sonunda, anlamaya başladıklarında gözlerinde beliren heyecanı net bir şekilde gözlemledim.",
            "Heyecan duydular çünkü bu aracın/teknolojinin sorunlarımızı etkili bir şekilde ele almamızı ve çözmemizi nasıl sağlayabildiğini hayal edebiliyorlardı. Dolayısıyla, teknik/yazılım arka planı olan kişilerdeki ve politika yapıcı insanlardaki bu heyecan sadece teorik bir hayranlığın sonucu değildi, daha ziyade Holochain'in bize sunduğu pratik fayda ihtimallerinin ve potansiyel çözümlerin farkına varmalarından kaynaklanıyordu. Holochain’in dijital hayatımızda yaratabileceği dönüştürücü etki ve kendi kaderlerini şekillendirmede bireylere ve topluluklara sunduğu imkânlar konusunda hakikî bir heyecan oluşmuştu."

Investing in a structure to support group coordination requires trust, and it would help if that trust didn’t rely on the stability of one person or company. Furthermore, Holochain addressed another problem: with traditional architecture, I would have the power, and in some cases legal responsibility, to monitor and censor users. For a system to provide real liberatory power, it couldn’t be run this way.  A platform designed for individuals to organize horizontally requires infrastructure that is also horizontal.

Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.",
            "IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.",
            "For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).",
            "IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.",

            "For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.",
            "Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy."

At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables.

            "If you've been following the Holochain/Holo story at all, you've probably heard that Holochain is \"agent centric\". Strictly speaking this is true, but unfortunately it has hidden a deeper truth about Holochain. Let me explain: we used the term * agent-centric * to distinguish Holochain from other software architectures (especially in the blockchain world) that are philosophically * data-centric *. The prime concern of blockchain ledgers is to create a single \"consensus\" view on a data reality in the distributed peer-to-peer world, where that's a known hard problem. In the case of Bitcoin, the idea is to create a data reality of the location of digital coins: who spent them and with whom. In the case of Ethereum, the idea is to create a data reality of not just coin locations, but also the state of a global computer that you can write and run programs on, i.e. \"smart-contracts\".",
            "The reason creating these data realities is a hard problem in the decentralized network world is that it's impossible to determine the absolute ordering of events. This is a simple fact of physics. In the client–server paradigm this isn’t even a problem, because we start from a centralized server where there is a canonical notion of what the data is and a canonical time. The central server stores the data reality. The brilliance of blockchain is that it provides a protocol for distributed peers to hold data reality together, be it the order of transaction of Bitcoins, or the ordering of computation steps on Ethereum. But it does this by enforcing a single ordering of events. The stupidity of blockchain is that the protocol it uses to enforce this single ordering of events is incredibly expensive, extremely wasteful of computation power, and generates obscene amounts of greenhouse gases. On top of all that, for almost all distributed collaborative applications it's not even necessary to keep one single global ordering of events. It’s easy to make this mistake of thinking so if your purpose is a trustless system that’s trying to track the location of digital coins, but it turns out that you can still solve that same problem a different way.",
            "Enter Holochain. The ** agent-centric ** view point starts from the understanding that data is derived from agency. It does not have “primary” ontological status.",
            "Data is essentially and fundamentally a record of a particular agent’s experience, be that a human, a sensor, or a device. In reality, agents see/sense/detect different things and receive feedback in different orders representing different realities. If any record’s provenance is separated from it, then the “data” represented by that record is fundamentally broken. We can only make sense of data if we know who sensed the data. This is why absolute ordering of massively simultaneous computation is impossible.",
            "But herein lies the \"unfortunate\" part that I mentioned before. I have seen people jumping on Holochain's agent-centricity as if it were an ideological stance about the supremacy of individual rights. It is true that the agent-centric approach will help achieve some crucial goals in individual rights, especially around privacy, and preventing inappropriately centralized entities (corporate or governmental) from abusing data privilege. But this is only the first part of the story.",
            "A Holochain application's architecture is better described as ** collaboration-centric **. Start with the reality of agency. Don't dis-empower these agents. Instead fully empower them to enter into non-coercive play together with agreed upon rule-sets. Then what you get is thrivable social-coherence. This is what Holochain is designed to embody.

Even for those of you who are, if you grew up doing so always with your git repos centralized on GitHub, you may be missing a key part of the decentralization story.",
            "For me, the first time I understood what distributed software and peer-to-peer really meant as an architectural reality was when I switched from Subversion to Git for version control. Subversion was based on the mental model of a centralized repository (a database of changes to the code’s text files) from which coders would 1) make local check-outs of that source code 2) edit the files, 3) and then make a commit (which is storing back into the database a set of such changes), but 4) you might have to merge your changes before you could make the commit if someone else had committed first, which entailed resolving any conflicting changes. Coders could also make a branch (which was a copy of the repository) and create a bunch of commits on that branch and merge those in too, but the mental model was still of some central place with a single “canonical” reality that the group of coders was updating.",
            "Git was different. Git assumes no center point. It assumes that each coder has their own copy of the code repository and can pull and push changes to any other distributed copy of the repo they have permission to access.

            "If you think that your git repository on GitHub is somehow special, well from git’s perspective it isn’t. It’s just a repo that a bunch of agents have agreed to use in a hub-and-spoke synchronization pattern. Your “git push” could be directly to your friends repos if they gave you access and you added them as a remote. In that case you would just be agreeing to a more mesh-like collaboration pattern.",
            "Of course github has loaded lots of collaboration value-add on top of just being a place to embody the hub-and-spoke pattern, with issues, pull requests, kan-ban boards, integrated CI, etc. This is an important part of the story which is part of a pattern that repeats: decentralized public-domain protocols spawn centralized proprietary value-add silos built on top of those protocols. The detailed story of another example of this—about how AOL, GEnie, and Prodigy created chat-rooms, news services and all kinds of proprietary value-add on top of the primary feature of the internet’s SMTP protocol that provided the core service, email—is one I will tell some other time. But the key there is that proprietary value-add was erased by the arrival of another set of open protocols: http and HTML. And I think that Holochain/Syn may be yet another example of this story of the orders-of-magnitude value level-up that happens in this evolutionary process.",

            "This last task is where things get tricky to do well, and in general can’t always be done in a fully automated way. However, the idea is that when necessary, a merge strategy would include human intervention: manually (i.e. using human judgement) resolving the differences between conflicting change sets. This is nothing new to git users who handle merge conflicts all the time! Note that it’s important that merge strategy is not generalized and specified per-app. This is part of the power of the Syn approach.",
            "Once this fifth task is done, Syn becomes a general framework for adding branching and merging to any collaborative app. At any given time, Syn has the notion of a session, which is just like a branch in git. It’s a commit to treat as a starting point for a series of changes. Unlike Google Docs which just has a single revision history, Syn provides, at the low level, a space for multiple version histories based simply on which session users join and start making changes. With merging, the realities these branches represent can become aligned. Because Syn supports generalized UI for creating/viewing/switching sessions and can insert the merging strategy defined by the particular app, this is a powerful pattern that used to be available only to coders using git. Now, suddenly, it can be applied to arbitrary collaboration apps. In a way, it’s two-level collaboration, synchronously on the “same” state, and asynchronously on divergent/convergent state.",
            "To me this is a big deal. If collaboration is about empowered agents entering into non-coercive playing together by agreed upon rule-sets, then this pattern in Syn is a massive level up meta-rule-set for doing so.",
            "Imagine Wikipedia articles with multiple branches that reflect the true differences we have rather than just being fights in the talk pages, frozen around the assumption that there is a single, neutral point-of-view. And because of their many branches, they can actually merge when people find a way to represent those divergences in ways that can be understood by those who were arguing. That’s next-level collaboration.",

            "Imagine the concrete vocabulary of conflict resolution that emerges as we develop new and interesting merge strategies for conflicting change sets in different application contexts. What does it mean to resolve two different color choices applied to the same object by different people in a drawing program? I can imagine an ad-hoc Syn app spinning up that lets people on the fly make proposals and vote, or do rock-paper-scissors, or whatever… all as part of resolving a merge conflict in another Syn app! That’s next level collaboration.",

The example above looks at a small-scale, individualistic form of walkaway, but as we’ll go on to see,  the larger more meaningful forms of walkaway require a collective.  Thus communities, not individuals, will gain the most benefit from walkaway. Whether an offshoot of an open-source coding collective or a local youth group fracturing from a larger institution, the ability to fork code and data gives a community a sort of sovereignty that does not depend on either the individual nor the institution/state.",

Each individual has the right to their own data, but the data created in the public sphere at the same time remains public. As we’ll see, this gains importance when social groups split, helping to maintain the social histories and accounts across spaces.  Thus, the group cannot hold an individual hostage, nor can any individual hold the group hostage by controlling the server."

Developed as a container for social interaction,  We  allows users to build highly customizable digital spaces for collaboration, without predetermining the nature of these spaces.  Users will be able to load “applets” into  We  to give it different functionalities from threaded chat and calendar invites to video calls, whiteboards, voting, and currencies. Because applets are just repackaged Holochain apps, almost all hApps could potentially be implemented within  We .",
            "Designed to be, per Einstein's provocation, “as simple as possible, but not simpler,”  We  is an interface for managing the boundaries and connections between different spaces. One example of this is cross applet functionality. When running multiple instances of the same applet in different  We  spaces at once you can easily shift between group-centric and applet-centric views, for example allowing you to see just the calendar events of your current group or all of your events across different groups at the same time.  We  provides developers affordances to enhance and enable both of these perspectives.",
            "The real strength of  We  comes from taking the idea of groupware and generalizing it beyond any one functionality, while at the same time allowing communities to form membranes and self govern.  As agent-centric software, each user decides what groups and applets they opt into.  Similarly, community governance would happen from an agent-centric basis. Bad actors can potentially be removed via ban lists that each user opts into rather than being censored from the top down. The overlapping decisions and interactions of individual agents form together into communities, rather than communities existing as something predefined. These principles and associated tools like  membrane proofs  and  capability grants  are inherited from Holochain itself.  We  just provides the structure and user interface needed for these networked relationships to be integrated and more accessible. Because every Holochain app has the structural properties of a  Sovereign Accountable Commons  (SAC), these social spaces can quickly morph into DAOs. As digital communities that need to make decisions collectively, each space will need  different levels of protocol  to help them embody their decisions and agreements.",

This doesn’t mean that their pasts were not entwined however; one group starting over from scratch while the other maintains the old platform sets up very different power relations than when both move forward from the same place, each with a copy of the data and the platform. Walkaway enables this type of continuity.",

Users either add or create this data and give the app its value.",

Thus fusion can happen all at once or slowly over time on an as needed basis; the same goes for walkaway. What’s beautiful about the Holochain architecture is that it allows rule sets to be brought together as composable chunks, thus meta-grammatics. The examples here and throughout this article describe just a small portion of the problem spaces that the 4 Fs bring with them. They also only illuminate a glimpse of the benefits.",

With an explosion of social spaces, users have a diversity of options to choose from. These communities and the grammers that support them break the norm of monolithic institutions which provide a singular way to navigate society, rather they give many different avenues through which to access community and social services.

For instance, the air through which sound travels is uncapturable (so long as no one invents a cone of silence). Conversely, messages sent by intermediary or through writing can be contorted, lost, or otherwise captured in transit, opening up vulnerabilities in the system. Scaling communication through the air is vastly limited; you can only speak so loudly. So creating a form of scalable communication that is uncapturable is key to addressing the forms of capture introduced by large scale systems and societies. In order to make an uncapturable form of writing, we developed Holochain as an open source, data integrity engine for building peer-to-peer apps. The technical details for how Holochain secures the communication architecture will be described for a general audience in forthcoming materials, but in the meantime we refer you to an alpha draft of our  whitepaper . It is also worth noting that our implementation doesn’t require any centralized servers or a shared global ledger and thus avoids the forms of capture that those systems open up, either in governance and security or in regulation.",

However, it can also be used to refer to any privatization of public resources, from literal enclosure with fences to the paywalling of publicly funded research or the patenting of plant genomes.

This brings its own set of challenges, for instance Holochain’s accountability mechanisms force certain data into the public sphere; but unlike blockchains with their global visibility, the required data transparency only extends to the group level. Similarly, defaults and intermediation are at least in part solved by easy forking of both platform and data in what we call  walkaway . And opaque mechanism design is limited by shared, openly accessible, consented-to rulesets that can be audited by anyone who can read source code. Without offering one totalizing solution, these tools work together to create capture resistant ecosystems from the ground up.

For one, because anyone can host the software and act directly peer-to-peer without a central server or ledger, the community gains a high level of autonomy. Beyond that, having clear, mutually shared rulesets helps to maintain security and ensure clarity through the varied governance stages. Holochain also follows almost the same process as laid out by Anticapture for changing the internal ruleset of a community, with the execute stage being managed by each agent for themselves autonomously from the rest. Finally, because every action within a Holochain app is signed, it is easy to trace any form of capture that does happen, no matter the stage of governance. This means communities can address any exploits that arise and continually become more capture-resistant.

Thus we need capture-resistant design across all layers, starting with a strong foundation in the medium of communication.",

Whether it’s data extraction or information manipulation, the black box of their algorithms create more separation than connection. Neighbourhoods' solution? Their “ Community Activation Wizard ” lets a group decide what goes into the box, determining how information is processed and privileged. These “generic tools for specific cultures” can help you go from group chat to  DAO , incubating group experimentation and evolution.",

Open source social media projects can be hesitant to determine users’ feed content or suggest that they implement methods of rating and assessment, and rightly so.

But the internet isn’t interesting because we can link computers together, it’s interesting because of what people do with that network. Thus, Neighbourhoods developed out of  deep care for the Holochain ecosystem , laying the first bricks on top of Holochain’s foundation. As a key piece of architecture for a P2P social web, Neighbourhoods is focused on creating a user-friendly experience that preserves the good parts of social media like discoverability and feed ordering. They see these as key affordances for adoption and want to give the control of those capacities back to the broader community.",

Hard forks break the continuity of social media and create challenging network effects, so the ease of updating on Holochain allows for a much more fluid experience. Individual users do not all need to run the same version of an app (as long as the  integrity  remains constant), so updates and forks can happen asynchronously, all while agents securely interact in the same neighborhood. This capability emphasizes agent-centricity and allows for complex, overlapping community dynamics.",

In turn, applets can be shared across  We  and Neighbourhoods with minimal changes, enabling developers’ experimentation and driving innovation across the Holochain ecosystem.

They have done a lot of work to maintain this in their working practices externally as well, running workshops and salons with early adopters to get community feedback as part of a  participatory design process . When building a tool that allows for so much customization, it’s important to ensure that groups working through the  Community Activation Wizard  have a clear understanding of what their choices affect, and so carefully communicating this information is a design challenge that requires (and creates the opportunity for) community input.

I don’t need work emails in my personal inbox, nor do I want to sign into social media with the email of my collaborative writing project.",
            "There is a tension between secure, authenticated, cross-platform digital identity and compartmentalized, fluid, personas that let us show up as different parts of ourselves in different spaces.  Thus attempts to develop a single identity tool that does it all face a lot of issues, from ethics to usability, that come from collapsing multiple personas into a single identity.",
            "For instance, one issue we can imagine is that my job title might be attached to my digital identity, which makes sense in a professional setting, but which I might not want to forefront in a social setting. Now, even without my digital identity credentials providing you that information, you could google me and learn it for yourself fairly easily, but there is a little bit of friction to that interaction — you have to intentionally seek the information out. This is where the concept of  progressive trust  comes in.",

In different settings I’m going to present different information about myself and slowly reveal more as it becomes relevant to an interaction.  This lets me disclose information at a rate that I'm comfortable with, maintaining my privacy, and for you to understand the information because you aren’t overwhelmed with every available fact about me, unable to distinguish what is important and what isn’t.",

Should my digital identity be controlled by a corporation like Google, as is the case for many people’s email addresses? There are often different answers to these questions depending on the particular use case, but as these infrastructures are developed it’s important to consider who they give power to. In many situations it should be possible for users to self-assert and control their identities.  Certainly, users should be able to control what information they make visible, when, and to who.",

This also meant that identity was balkanized, without any continuity between digital spaces. To this day, many websites require unique login details. But a new option has become prevalent. You can sign into many websites via a third party like Apple, Google, or Facebook that acts as the authority on who you are. You gain continuity between digital spaces and the individual sites no longer hold your password — which is good for security but centralizes data into the hands of a few organizations. This is how digital identity works for most today.",

The Verifiable Credential then is filled with all the appropriate information about the particular credential, including who is issuing it.

The owner of the credential also has the ability to present only part of the information in the credential if they desire.

Many current digital identity infrastructures tie to legal identity in some way or another depending on the level of security needed.

For more secure implementations like KYC on exchanges and the like, you have to provide direct confirmation of your legal identity by uploading images of your state issued ID or similar documentation.",

The methods they use feel more like the  key signing parties  of old, but updated for the modern internet.  So instead of getting together in person to check each other’s public keys, they authenticate identity on a peer-to-peer basis via video chat or recorded attestations.  The protocols also utilize social graphs or other mechanisms like financial incentives/penalties   to help weed out bots and fake accounts.",

The diversity of ways that we interact online don’t all require legal identity, and many would be negatively affected by it.

If progressive trust tools are in place and everyone has the ability to keep their information private (while sharing certain details with the platform for safety) then the site might function fairly similarly to how dating sites do today. But if those tools aren’t in place, or if there is a culture that doesn’t prioritize them, then we might expect some serious privacy issues. For instance, if Alice is a whale and has her crypto accounts linked to her DID, Bob might have ulterior incentives for asking Alice out. They might also judge each other based on their college degrees, height, genetics, or any other metric that might be attached to their identities via a Verifiable Credential.",

These parties are always bound together in responsibility and agency. Digital identity seems to have a similar dynamic with the tension between identity infrastructures and our multiple lived identities.",
            "Rather than a proper conclusion, I want to leave this article with an invitation to think expansively and critically about identity, and to join us as we continue to explore digital identity and how Holochain might factor in.  As always, Holochain is committed to holding space for the complexity of these issues and is looking to approach identity with sensitivity and intention.  We obviously have strong beliefs about the matter, but I don't want this to be a one-sided conversation led by supposed experts — I want it to be a starting point for discussions which will lead to much richer answers than we could come up with alone. More soon."

What if the soil is depleted and the food is overprocessed because of enclosed-carrier dynamics that have created  big-ag  and  big-food  giants who control much of the market — and whose incentives are directly misaligned with our nutritional needs?",
            "Independent family farming used to be much more common [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]. But increased centralization throughout the food markets have  made it more difficult for farmers to survive  without growing big. “Get big or get out,” said Earl Butz, Richard Nixon’s Secretary of Agriculture  said in 1973 . Today, it’s the largest growers — or at least the ones that subscribe to the big-ag programs for seed, feed, fertilizer, and distribution — that enjoy reliable access to the financing needed to compete at scale. And garnering space at grocery chains, even at the more principled ones such as Whole Foods, often  requires 6-figure slotting fees  and the ability to produce at massive scale.",
            "Want to ‘buy local’? Good luck: you’re limited to what’s available during the growing season in your area, and you’ll pay  more than at the supermarket  because local growers generally can’t come close to matching mass-produced pricing. Want to go organic? Studies suggest that the herbicides known as glyphosates — which Monsanto markets as Roundup, and which the World Health Organization has concluded is  “probably carcinogenic to humans”  — make their way  into water supplies  and even  organic crops .",
            "Our access to food is controlled by centralized market players that we don’t get to choose.  Mega-corporations like Kraft & Nestle control companies up and down the whole supply chain. Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same. Farmers are paid simply for pounds of yield, so they understandably favor the cheapest way to achieve high outputs, without regard to the nutritional content of the food or the harmful effects of chemical herbicides or fertilizers.",
            "And regulators and legislators, many of whom are former big-ag executives or at least receive campaign funding from them, naturally favor centralized interests over those of independent growers.",

A newer generation of certifications focus on “ sustainable ” growing practices and even “ regenerative ” ones, meaning they restore the health of ecosystems that have been degraded through industrial farming or other industry.",
            "Labels may be only partial indicators — organic food can still come from depleted soil, for example — but at least they move the industry in the right direction. And they point to an opportunity to create massively greater accountability in our food supply chains, incentivizing producers through market dynamics to do right by the consumers.",
            "Yet supply-chain transparency and consumer information really only works at scale in the case of carrier unenclosability. Without it, certifications themselves can easily become stale or  corrupt . The ability to create a new certification standard needs to be like creating a new turn of phrase in a language: anyone can do it, and the expression spreads if it’s useful, rather than being subject to centralized (government or corporate) oversight over what takes hold. This way, any community can invent, evolve, and enforce the kind of quality assurance that it needs.",
            "One promising example is the  Just One Organics Living Economy System  (JOOLES), which plans to incentivize regenerative, high-nutrition growing practices by creating a feedback loop directly within the economics of food production. Growers who maintain high soil standards (as verified by spectroscopic analyses of the nutritional content of their produce) gain access to valuable contracts for their grade-B produce known as ‘seconds’ as well as interest-free credit lines that they can use to increase their growing capacity."

            "Today, even as healthier growing practices become theoretically more profitable as a result of rising consumer demand, many farmers remain entrenched in low-nutrition, high-chemical growing practices because they lack access to the funding required to shift their operations. It’s the biggest agriculture companies that have access to the cheapest funding, and they make that funding available only to growers who buy the company’s products, sell the company their outputs, or both. Low-quality, high-yield agriculture remains dominant, at least in part, because existing powers have an incentive to perpetuate their already-profitable practices, despite their destructive impacts and growing consumer appetites for something different.",
            "Projects like JOOLES have the potential to flip that script by linking quality-oriented producers directly with funding from quality-oriented consumers. And doing so using a framework like Holochain ensures that, while money can flow to companies who create value for consumers, no one will be able to concentrate power by virtue of saying who can or cannot transact or collaborate.  In a world of unenclosable carriers, consumers will be empowered to continually invent new structures to incentivize the nutrition they actually want, free from the enclosures of entrenched interests that seek to extract short-term profits."

They have  worked to curtail production of solar power in homes  by lobbying to eliminate tax breaks for solar installations. When ‘net-metering’ legislation has been introduced to require that utility companies pay consumers for surplus power produced at home, energy companies have  lobbied against it  and successfully eliminated it in several U.S states, in some cases doing so explicitly on the grounds that solar proliferation could hurt their profits. Even U.S. government agencies have moved to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition by alternative energy sources, pursuing policies to  discourage utility companies from investing in renewables .",

The challenge is circumventing the destructive grip the leading energy corporations have on the market that keeps innovations from proliferating.  If communities of consumers, researchers, property owners, and entrepreneurs were able to collaborate and transact with true freedom, we could rapidly evolve new approaches to our energy problems.",
            "Here are just a few kinds of solutions waiting to spread their wings in an unenclosable system:",
            "A. Self-owned, self-generated power : the production of power on one’s own property, for one’s own use. One recent study found that residential solar production alone  could supply around a quarter of the United States’   total energy needs . Add in the rest of usable rooftop space nationwide and  you get to 39% , while California, where it’s especially sunny, could produce 74% of its power just through solar on existing rooftops.",
            "B. Peer-produced power and micro-exchanges : the sharing of self-generated power across peer networks, with payments made through unenclosable currencies from those who net-consume power to those who net-provide power. Imagine if everyone were simply buying and selling electricity to one another – harvested from sun, wind, and rivers –  with absolutely no centralized entity brokering or extracting value from those transactions. This ‘Internet of Energy’ is what  Redgrid ,  powered by Holochain , aims to create.",
            "C. Smart grids:  comprehensive restructuring of power grids to increase efficiency and decrease fuel usage, required infrastructure, and pollution.  Smart grids  involve different components (such as appliances, meters, and  power conditioners ) ‘talking’ to each other and taking actions that reduce or balance system loads across time. For example, a smart grid might cause air conditioners at neighboring buildings to ‘take turns’ cycling on and off, thereby reducing spikes in overall usage and, in turn, reducing the amount of  peak power  that the grid needs to be built to provide. Today, energy companies have incentives to suppress smart-grid technology since it threatens their current business models, but in a world of unenclosable carriers and open energy exchanges, micro-markets could emerge where small players compete to establish healthier patterns of energy use.",
            "D. Novel developments in energy production.  In a climate of unfettered research and development, resources could also flow to a variety of promising energy research frontiers (beyond wind and solar) that make sense to pursue but are today disregarded as fringe by centralized economic channels. Waves, tides, geothermal sources,  deep ocean water , and even  fusion ,  cold fusion ,  zero-point energy , and  over-unity devices  have yielded promising discoveries which have been  shelved or blocked  within today’s centralized energy climate. With peer-production and smart grids in place, it could become economically feasible to create a ready evaluation path and an open market for every garage inventor’s creative energy solutions."

            "The very idea that energy production needs to be centralized is actually fairly new.  During the early industrial age 150 or 200 years ago, you didn’t need to plug into a centralized, monopoly-owned grid to run your factory; you just needed a river to turn your belts.  Even steam engines that ran trains and turned heavy equipment could run on wood harvested and renewed within the local forest.",
            "As foreign as it may sound today, decentralized power production was once the norm and could easily be again, sending centralized facilities the way of industrial-age relics like broadcast TV service, print-newspaper conglomerates, and the U.S. Postal Service. This is especially true now because we have technologies not just for  producing  large amounts of energy locally, but also for efficiently  distributing  and  transacting  for it across peer-to-peer networks. Add in the possibility of major funding sources being directed to mainly support, rather than suppress, the scaling of clean energy solutions, and we have a whole new ball game when it comes to powering humanity for centuries to come.",
            "Of course, all of this would require a complete dismantling of the current enclosures around our energy systems. Existing patterns perpetuate because existing incentive structures perpetuate them. The future of energy production, like the future of nutrition, must be underpinned by the ability for groups to spin up new patterns of coordination at will.",

            "In our enclosable, centralized system of currency, money is issued as debt by the banks [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ], with more debt always being created than money issued. This forces the issuance of more money each year than the previous (and thus more debt) in order to keep up with interest and avoid collapse due to foreclosures, defaults, and bankruptcies. Through compounding interest, this debt grows exponentially, ever widening the gap between money owed and the money supply available to repay it. The debt is owed by individuals, corporations, and governments who rely on borrowed money in order to invest in homes, infrastructure, and so on — all of whom then need to earn even more each year as interest compounds. The economy is literally forced to grow, or collapse.",

Just like in a  Ponzi Scheme , this cycle continues and builds exponentially until it reaches its limits of growth, at which point it collapses."

And we previously explored how blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, despite their rhetoric, are actually enclosable and are ultimately subject to the same pitfalls of centralized power as corporations and governments. But if we toss out all of our assumptions, we can actually imagine currency taking on entirely new forms. Here are two.",
            "A. Mutual credit. In a mutual credit system, currency is issued not by a central authority, but by participants granting each other credit according to mutually agreed-upon rules. Money is issued when someone spends into the negative, thus borrowing against the system, while others keep positive balances by receiving revenue before they spend. Since every transaction involves offsetting positive and negative balance adjustments, the currency supply is  net-zero , meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero, just like on a balance sheet.",
            "The rules for who can draw credit vary among mutual credit systems, but one favored approach is to allow only established producers of value to borrow money. In  HoloFuel , for example — the currency system of the  Holo hosting network , which is powered by Holochain — users who have demonstrated past capacity to provide hosting power receive lines of credit backed by their future hosting. Thus, not only are “loans” backed by actual value being created, but the very size of the active currency supply — the sum total of the positive balances (which is the inverse of the sum total of debt) — is grounded in the actual size, the  actual supply and demand , of the hosting economy.",
            "Similarly, JOOLES, which we mentioned earlier in this article, is a mutual-credit currency backed by the production of food, with the money supply growing or shrinking proportionally to the supply and demand for produce.",
            "With the currency supply grounded in the economic output it represents – and with no debt created beyond what’s issued directly for value-creators – there’s no ‘economy’ that needs to keep growing just to feed itself.  And with currency issued directly by the value producers, no one can extract value just by virtue of having a monopoly on money issuance. A mutual-credit currency based on an unenclosable carrier such as Holochain is truly peer-to-peer, completely free of any centralized components.",
            "A bonus benefit of mutual credit is that it may bypass the challenges that many cryptocurrencies face with regard to securities laws (which are themselves a form of carrier enclosure). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in particular has a penchant for shutting down blockchain-based projects that issue speculative tokens, but because mutual credit is issued only in the moments when value is actually exchanged, it is not a future-based investment and, as such, may be difficult to classify as a security.",
            "B. Triple-bottom-line currencies. Triple-bottom-line currencies are another way of optimizing currency, and thereby the economy, for wide collective benefit. You may have heard of  triple-bottom-line (TBL) accounting , which some companies use to evaluate their performance on the basis of not only  profit  but also  people,  which is the well-being of everyone impacted by the business, and  planet , which is the business’s impact on the natural environment. (Profit, people, and planet are sometimes known as the three ‘P’s.) TBL accounting is an attempt to account for, or ‘internalize’, the  externalities  of transactions, which is to say the costs (or benefits) of doing business that are not reflected in revenues. It’s a noble idea, but it’s impossible to accurately account for a transaction’s externalities, given all the hidden and chain reactions that take place in the complex systems of human dynamics and planetary ecosystems.",
            "Another way of stating this problem is that any company’s internal assessment of their external effects is skewed by the company’s limited perspective (which is a kind of enclosure in its own right) even if it has the best intentions.",
            "In an unenclosable financial system, however, there’s a way around the problem: incorporating  external  feedback loops into the  currency itself , based on input from people who are in a position, from vantage points outside the company, to assess its external impacts. This way, instead of expecting companies to care about people and planet and  also  do impossible accounting, a TBL currency enables a much simpler thing, which is to allow a company’s  reputation  for doing good or harm to impact its overall cost of doing business.",
            "This approach is actually similar to what we know today as credit ratings, which are essentially reputation currencies that act in conjunction with today’s money systems to affect the cost and availability of money. But credit ratings factor in only your payment history, which corresponds to just one of the P’s: your ability to earn money (profit) and, in turn, reliably make profit for the bankers who lend you money. A ‘triple credit rating’, which could drive a ‘triple-bottom-line currency’, would also factor in your effects on people and planet. One possible approach could be:",
            "(i) Your  people rating  affects your  interest rates , in order to make it more attractive for you to borrow money if you’re deemed to affect people positively through your commerce, and less attractive if you’re not.",
            "(ii) Your  planet rating  affects your  transaction fees , with the idea being that polluters and extractors pay a tax to the system to offset the environmental costs borne by everyone. If you have a reputation for positively impacting the planet, you could actually incur a negative tax, which means you’re essentially being paid to transact by the system, in reflection of the good you externalize.",
            "(iii) Your  profit rating  affects your  credit limits , similar to existing credit ratings, with the idea being that your likelihood to pay back funds ought to remain a central factor in how much you can borrow."

Of course  such an extractive system is driving a pattern of cancerously consuming the planet’s natural resources in the almighty name of Economic Growth. Of course we’re burning cheap but limited energy stores instead of building renewable infrastructure. And of course we’re farming in ways that maximize pounds of yield over soil health and more sustainable growing practices.",
            "One mechanism by which today’s debt-driven economy has such a troubling effect is through the  time cost of money , which means that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later.   With debt everywhere, compounding interest is everywhere, so carrying a negative balance is expensive, while carrying a positive balance can be lucrative. The time cost of money incentivizes everyone to liquidate physical assets for cash as soon as possible. A tree is worth more dead than alive, goes one saying.",
            "In other words: no matter what business asset you own — a forest, a website, a factory — you have an incentive to convert that asset into numbers on a balance sheet as quickly as possible, even if it could produce  more  cash on a longer timeline. The more cash you can get now, the more you can put that cash to work in high-return financial instruments. Plus, if you’re like most business owners, you’re  paying  interest on the loans you took to capitalize your business — as well as on your personal debt (home, cars, college, and so on) — and cash could help pay off those costly loans.",

Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but  compoundingly  profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.",
            "Speaking of which: the fact that it’s even  possible  to outstrip the carrying capacity of our ecosystem is, in part, a function of our currency supply being disconnected from the limits of the physical systems upon which the economy operates. Reconnecting these two phenomena is actually imperative for having a sustainable economy: if we don’t, we have no guardrails against outstripping the planet’s capacity to regenerate itself.",
            "Mutual credit systems have a particularly seamless ability to connect to the carrying capacity of an economy, since the creation of currency can be strictly a function of spending into the negative by those who have demonstrated the ability to produce actual value, and the currency is backed by their future production of that value. Such a system also shifts the power away from the bankers who derive influence from their ability to create and charge for the money supply, allocating power instead to the value-creators themselves (those who are actually able to provide for people’s needs). Add in a triple-credit rating system and you bring  greater  good into the equation as well.",

It may be difficult to place a number, but any true-value calculation would have to account for the myriad ways the forest contributes to the greater ecosystem (and the economy) by continuing to exist: the carbon storage that keeps the planet from overheating, the oxygen supply that keeps us breathing, the rare tropical hardwoods which might be harvested sustainably over time, the utility of plants as food and medicine, the biodiversity that took billions of years to evolve and helps sustain food chains worldwide.",

            "For example: How many hours of use per year does the average suburban lawnmower see? Maybe an hour a week for part of the year? That means they sit idle more than 99.7% of the time… yet it’s typical to have one in every household, causing all manner of negative externalities through their manufacturing, raw materials, waste, and (often) indoor storage space. Conventional accounting celebrates the manufacturing, sale, and maintenance of all these lawnmowers as positive numbers in “the economy”, but there’s a bigger picture badly missed by that perspective. Can you imagine the massive net benefit if neighborhoods could easily coordinate their use of lawnmowers through a shared-ownership, shared-use system built on unenclosable carriers?",
            "Expanding outward, cars also seem ripe for this kind of exploration, as do, say, many kitchens and laundry spaces. Maybe someday even land might not need to be individually owned, but rather commonly owned and privately leased. This is the basis of Georgist economics, or  Georgism , which also imagines that lease-holders could reap benefits from improving the land and be taxed for extracting resources from the land.",
            "But we don’t need to go full Georgist to imagine hybrid systems – ‘sharing economies’ – that would retain basic property ownership but still lead to more efficient use of resources. One version is a kind of  land-weaving society  in which owners permit the use of their property for a variety of beneficial purposes, using reputation and certification to authorize access. If I have a permaculture certification, for example, I might be invited to farm your land, perhaps for a fee or a share of yield, or maybe because it benefits you in other ways, like soil improvement or social rewards. Other certifications might permit me to sustainably harvest wood, gather food or medicinal herbs, hunt, or graze your livestock. “No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints, with RFID or smartphone-based tracking – and with micropayments transferring automatically in cryptocurrencies as agreed upon.",
            "For a land-weaving type of approach to remain effective at any kind of scale, it would be critical that the systems for granting and tracking access — and for tracking reputations and certifications — be guaranteed to always remain fully decentralized, which means being built on an unenclosable carrier framework like Holochain."

            "What’s typical today is that only those who own or fully rent a piece of land can make much use of it. But this tight coupling of ownership and stewardship makes holding natural resources unlucrative as compared to liquidating them, due to the costs of ownership and the time cost of money. But we can begin to imagine how, if we decouple ownership from stewardship, the balance could tip such that growing the capacity of the land is more beneficial to the landowner than depleting it.",
            "The closest analog we have today to what something like this might look like might be national parks, but these exist mainly as nature preserves reliant on government subsidies (and a bit of tourism revenue). As a result, they are subject to all the complications of centralized power, including  lobbying , politically motivated  government shutdowns , and even  declassification from protected status  by unilateral action.",
            "In order to truly tip the balance such that stewarding a rainforest on an ongoing basis is more advantageous than destroying it for cash, multiple land uses need to be allowed to occur: not solely ecotourism, or harvesting edibles, or gathering medicinals or wood, but all of these and more, all gated through the appropriate membranes of access such as certifications, reputation systems, and fee structures.",
            "And because each of these land uses are complex in their own right, it might not be one enterprise operating all of them, but various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency. For instance, the group permitted to harvest lumber might mark the trees they plan to cut down with three months’ notice, so that the gatherers could prioritize harvesting food, herbs, and other materials from those trees in particular. The type of coordination this requires is what makes unenclosable carriers so important: to whatever extent the coordination is channeled through central points of control, the system will corrupt over time, with power and money flowing to those who control the means of coordination.",
            "Growing What’s Ours Extrapolating from the idea of sharing economies, we might begin to completely reimagine what it means to solve for scarcity in general. As the naturalist Paul Krafel has pointed out in his enlightening (if productionally spartan) short film  The Upward Spiral , there are basically two responses when faced with limited resources: one is to compete to maximize your own personal gain at the expense of others’, and the other is to act and interact in patterns that expand the amount of usable resources for everyone (including yourself).",
            "We call the first strategy ‘get mine’, and we call the second ‘grow ours’. And what’s fascinating is that if you look across natural history, it’s ‘grow ours’ that evolution selects for over time, contrary to what we might infer from the ‘survival of the fittest’ narrative dominant within our cultural understanding of evolution (and in nature documentaries).  Natural selection might actually be better understood as ‘ survival of the  fit ’, as in “those whose characteristics are most fit for their environs are most likely to survive”.  And a great way of being highly fit to one’s environs is to treat existing resources regeneratively, using the ones that exist to produce even more valuable resources.",
            "Plants are great as this. They combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain. And look at how well that works out for them: they have literally spread to most of the surface area on earth, and they make up a vast majority of biomass on the planet. Carnivorous mammals, which need to employ more ‘get mine’ than plants to compete for limited food, are far more rare. But even they typically take only what they need, and not more than can be renewed, from their surroundings and from prey populations.",
            "Growing ours is a good strategy in part because most of the resources we need to survive  are  actually renewable, meaning there’s an infinite supply if we treat them regeneratively. When we’re only competing against one another for how quickly we can extract those resources and short-term-profit from them, we outstrip the carrying capacity of the incredible engine of life that is our sun-fueled natural ecosystem, and the engine stops. On the other hand, when we take on a posture of enhancing the regenerative behaviors of ecosystems, the engine thrives, and so does humanity.",
            "It’s not that ‘get mine’ is not useful in the right context and scale; individual agents within a market often need to compete for shares of a pie. But that’s precisely why it’s so critical that, at a collective level, we have feedback loops that check and balance our overall consumption, or else we’re just like a yeast colony that overconsumes its environment and causes its own demise. We must have systems that track our impact and make it visible, facilitate and reward the sharing of resources, and incentivize working together to leave the pie at least as big as we found it. And these systems must be built on unenclosable carriers or they will get hijacked again and again for the benefit of only a few, and the story plays out once more – different cast maybe, but same outcome."

            "Here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are standing at the outset of a similar explosion, only this time, it’s  social organisms , not biological ones, that are emerging. And it’s social DNA, not biological DNA, that is powering it.",
            "Just as biological organisms are more than the sum of their cellular parts, with the whole living on as the cells die and are replaced, social organisms (or  social patterns ) are forms of collective coordination that live on beyond the participation of particular individuals. Corporations and governments are the most familiar examples, having dominated the human systems landscape for centuries, with religious groups, tribes, and all kinds of community structures also in the mix along the way.",
            "Early challenges to that dominance began decades ago with experiments in more participatory ownership (such as different kinds of  cooperatives ) and more participatory governance (such as  liquid democracies ), but it’s really the ‘ Web2 ’ era of user-generated content, with its social networks and online marketplaces, that kicked the explosion into higher (second?) gear.",
            "Now, ‘ Web3 ’ organisms like decentralized marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) use blockchain-based smart contracts to eliminate the need for corporate or government intermediaries entirely. Even though these new organisms end up giving power to  new  intermediaries (as we discussed in  Part 1 of this series ), they are still shaking the snow globe and enabling us to at least imagine a world without centralized power.",
            "The aim of this article has been to hint at such a world. Mutual credit, peer energy exchanges, sharing economies… these are examples of the kinds of social organisms that might emerge in an era of truly peer-to-peer communication and collaboration, built on a system of unenclosable carriers. But there are so many more unknowns than knowns about this new era. When any two or two billion people can invent new ways of interacting, unfettered by anyone moderating their behavior without their permission, the DNA of social organisms evolves with unprecedented speed. New ideas are encoded and tried, with the most fit being refined, combined, iterated, and propagated.",

Imagine you’re the CEO of a huge multinational corporation, and it’s your job to keep a pulse on the whole organization and to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues as they arise. Today, you get the information you need periodically in dense reports containing financial statements and other long-form statistics. The report has taken time to compile from all the different departments and field locations, so by the time you receive it it’s not very current. Plus it takes you time to read it, digest it into a mental model, and hopefully draw some kind of useful conclusions about the complex system the data represents.",
            "But let’s say that this is the future, and you get your information very differently. What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers. Each type of fish represents some part of the massive, complex system you’re managing, while the fishes’ behavior — like how fast or high they’re swimming, or how coordinated a school’s movements — represents some metric, interpreted and compiled by the sort of advanced intelligence that’s already available today.",
            "What works so well about this scenario is not just that the data is delivered in real time, but also that it’s delivered in a format that is consistent with how the human perceptual system is designed to operate. You have on the wall in your office not paragraphs, charts, and graphs, but a simulated ecosystem acting as the real-time health monitor of a complex system, displayed in such a way that you can take in large amounts of information at a glance, millions of simultaneous data points even, by observing patterns among the fish or their environs: the rippling seaweed, the blooming algae, the bubbles, the water’s cloudiness, the current, the light. When something seems ‘off’, you open up an interface on your computer, click on the item of interest, and drill in for more information.",
            "Imagine how effective you would be at taking the pulse of a system and adapting to it under these conditions.",
            "Now imagine that it’s not just the CEO who has access to this monitor, but actually everyone in the company as well, in corners of their screens or on the walls in their departments, maybe with their views adapted according to what’s most relevant for their work. Now instead of only a few executives being responsible for managing everything, the whole is holding the whole. Everyone can see the system they’re impacting, feel a direct relationship to it, and problem-solve for its optimal health. Can you imagine how the spirit of ‘grow ours’ could spread across an organization if all the people who were actually doing the work to bring about change could see the effect of their activities on the system?",
            "Now consider applying these kinds of feedback mechanisms to all manner of global conditions: intercontinental trade, harmony among peoples, and, yes, the health of rainforests, oceans, and the atmosphere.  How much faster might we solve humanity’s most intractable problems if we were all seeing the impact of our collective action in real time?  If we were problem-solving not through marching-in-the-streets social activism that tries to compel power brokers to act against their own economic interests, but rather by tapping into humankind’s collective creativity to invent new social and economic patterns that incentivize everyone to grow the whole?",
            "What we’re talking about here is a quantum leap in coordinative capacity that doesn’t actually require a vast leap in technological capacity, at least not in the ‘high-tech’ sense. It’s more like the arising of language than advancements in nuclear fusion or space travel. Sure, there’s complexity in building an unenclosable framework for decentralized software applications, but the leap is mainly about arranging building blocks into new, more eloquent, more sustainable forms.",
            "The fundamental technology needed, therefore, is a  coordinative  technology, one that facilitates the mashing up and remixing of components quickly and with as few barriers as possible. We need an efficient, tamper-proof, and resilient carrier for social DNA.",

It provides a way of ensuring the  integrity and accuracy of data  in a network while also enabling every user to host and represent their own data.  Rather than having actions validated and information verified by centralized entities (as in internet apps) or  global consensus mechanisms  (as in blockchain apps) — both of which are enclosable and result in power imbalances (see  Part 1 ) — actions and data within Holochain apps are validated entirely peer-to-peer.",
            {
              "lists": [
                "By “ framework ”, we mean a database for storing, organizing, and finding data that is spread across many computers, so that no one has to hold a lot of data. In Holochain apps there can be data that remains local to one’s own computer, on what’s called a Source Chain, and there can be data that is shared across many computers, on what’s called a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).",
                "By “ peer-to-peer applications ”, we mean a version of decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted entirely by the participants in the app, rather than by a central company. (Holochain applications are sometimes called  hApps .) There are no limits to the kinds of apps that might be built on Holochain, other than that they have to involve two or more parties communicating or transacting. Apps for social networking, currency systems, ride-sharing, travel booking, buying and selling, team coordination, collective decision-making, chat, weather, and news applications are all possible.  Most ways that you currently interact digitally with people or businesses, as well as many ways you might imagine doing so, can be built on Holochain and can probably be enhanced by unenclosability.",
                "By “ data integrity ”, we mean the assurance that data cannot be tampered with once it has been created, including by anyone storing data about themselves on their own Source Chain. For example, if you have 100 currency units and you spend 50, it has  integrity  for you to represent to the network that you have 50 units remaining; it would  not  have integrity for you to be able to represent that you still have 100. Similarly, it would not have integrity if you could display a 5-star user rating when the average of your ratings is actually 3 stars.  Holochain provides a way of cryptographically ensuring that if you misrepresent any data, such as your account balance or reputation score, it will be obvious, and your communication or transaction will be flagged and rejected by the peer-based validation mechanisms."

And you always store and own your own data, taking it with you as you move between applications, which is not possible with internet search engines, social networks, or shopping sites — or even blockchain apps.",
            "Holochain enables direct interaction.  With Holochain, you act truly peer-to-peer, free from intermediaries except those you freely choose. You and your actions write directly to the ledger of events, and you share only share with the network what you have agreed to share according to the terms of whichever apps you have freely chosen to participate in. You represent yourself, rather than being subject to representation by central authorities like legislators, miners, stakers, or even internet service providers.",
            "Direct interaction also means that  Holochain functions on any network . It can operate through the internet (TCP/IP) but doesn’t require it; apps can just as easily operate on mesh networks or even local area networks, Bluetooth networks, or any other means of communicating data among peers. Even when offline from the larger network of app users, a subgroup of connected peers can run the app with full functionality among themselves (since  everyone  hosts a copy of the core application code) and synchronize their changes with the network later.",
            "Holochain enables groups of any size, whether 2 people or 2 billion people, to operate on a shared set of agreements . Most blockchains have problems at the low end, requiring hundreds if not thousands of players before there is enough of a distributed consensus mechanism to prevent attacks by a majority of nodes. And so far, blockchain-based dApps (decentralized applications) haven’t demonstrated much of an ability to scale beyond  a few thousand active users , suggesting they may have problems at the high end too. For a carrier to be unenclosable, it’s important that any number of people can interact and mutually enforce the integrity of the space they’re participating in.",
            "Holochain is free to use.  Since all users host themselves on Holochain, there is no need for costly central hosting infrastructure as there is in web apps, nor any need to pay tax-like ‘gas’ fees to miners or stakers to run the network as there is in blockchain apps. Each peer carries a bit of extra load to store and validate a portion of the information that’s distributed to the group. Any fees that occur in Holochain apps are chosen and mutually enforced by those freely participating within a given app space, with no revenues skimmed by the network.",

In fact, most Web-2.0 revenue models still work for Holochain apps, including: - ‘Software as a subscription’ (Saas), with or without a free trial - ‘Freemium’ in which a free version remains functional while subscribers get upgraded features - Service fees, like on Airbnb or Uber - Fees for hosting data, like on Dropbox or Gmail - Sponsorships from service providers relevant to the audience - Promoted listings by item sellers or service providers, like on Amazon and eBay - Donations, like on Wikipedia",

            "Of course, for people that  do  want to create hApps just for the common good and not for profit, Holochain makes that easier because the infrastructure costs are so low. Maybe you want to set up a reputation-enabled child-care directory because you want easier, safer access to reliable babysitters and nannies in your neighborhood, not because you want to make money. You can do that without needing to configure, manage, or pay for servers, plus Holochain’s developer tools simplify app development (more on those in a bit).

            "Today, a single person’s message can reach billions of people in seconds. This phenomenon, which would have been unfathomable to prehistoric humans, exists thanks to a progression of carrier technologies that have emerged over thousands of years, including written records, the printing press, sound amplification and recording, radio, television, film and, more recently, the internet, email, and social media. These developments have  unleashed tremendous human coordination, but, as a side effect, we have surrendered covert power to those who control the carriers, enabling them to decide what gets transmitted and how we interact with each other.",
            "Our mainstream monetary systems are examples of carrier enclosure, too, since they empower governments and financial institutions to say what counts as legitimate currency and trade, as well as to make fiscal policies that affect the behavior of our currencies. Blockchain technology commendably turns over the job of legitimizing transactions to a ‘decentralized’ consensus network, but it still converges to the same side effect, simply replacing governments and corporations with people who control computing power and cryptotokens.  A system that is unenclosable is not just decentralized; it cannot ever be centralized.",
            "Over the centuries, the power and wealth differentials have become so extreme that instead of a level economic playing field we have a steep mountainside that most people aren’t able to climb. (We explored some of these imbalances and their consequences in  Part 2 of this series .) When disproportionately powerful people (understandably) act in their own interest, it often comes at the expense of the greater good. This is why many of humanity’s greatest challenges — rainforest destruction, pollution and climate instability, food supply degradation, the looming energy crisis, and so on —  won’t be solved at the levels of policy or diplomacy, but only by shifting the underlying architectures that determine how wealth and power are allocated and how people are incentivized to act .",
            "The good news is that such a shift is technologically possible in ways it hasn’t been before. Suddenly, at the outset of the 2020s and for the first time in history,  we are now able to build communication and transaction systems that let us have it both ways: capacity for massive scale  and  freedom from the power distortions of enclosability . What is available, and what we must undertake, is a proliferation of new forms of social organizing so expansive that it deserves to be named analogously to the Cambrian Explosion of new biological organisms. We call it the Holocene Explosion, after the current geological epoch.",

If someone comes to have broader influence than someone else, it’s not because of carrier control, but because that person has gained capabilities according to rules voluntarily opted-into by the people participating in that app space. If anyone doesn’t like the rules of a given space, they are free to leave and join or start another, and since they own their data, they can take it with them."

            "We considered getting into how  scalable  Holochain apps are – how easily they can accommodate millions or billions of users because everyone shares in the work of writing and storing data. Or how  fast  they are – how they enable virtually-real-time interaction. These are actually key reasons, beyond unenclosability, that Holochain may be more suitable than blockchain for real-world collaborative applications. But we covered these topics in the  Holochain-blockchain comparison  we published recently, so you can go there if you want to learn more about them.",
            "We also considered talking about how a truly unenclosable, peer-to-peer future implies a truly peer-to-peer  internet , completely replacing the existing one. But this seems like a story for another time.",
            "We have said – but it's probably worth reiterating – that we can only speculate about what new social forms will emerge through the Holocene Explosion (see  Part 2 ). We’ve also said, or at least implied, that Holochain’s architects don’t claim to fully know how it will be used in the future: the idea in designing it was not to build a whole bunch of new social patterns, but rather to build a  framework  for new social patterns. This means that the list of possible Holochain apps we shared earlier is truly partial; it’s likely that the most profound and transformative uses for the framework will only emerge over time. (Even  within  the apps we listed earlier, the most transformative  features  are TBD: novel incentive systems, governance systems, currency designs, and so on, yet to be invented.)",
            "We have also said that what makes Holochain so suitable for rapid evolution is its unenclosable nature: Holochain is peer-to-peer, agent-centric, free to use, and able to operate on any transport protocol (even without the existing internet). From  Part 1 of this series : “With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off.”",
            "If there’s one more aspect of Holochain worth mentioning, it might be how Holochain the  project  (distinct from Holochain the  framework ) is building an ecosystem to foster experimentation and iteration. Creating a truly optimized evolutionary space isn’t just a matter of building the right core technology; it’s a matter of making that technology as easy to utilize as possible. To that end, Holochain the project is creating:",

            "In one sense, Holochain is quite a simple piece of software: it’s a lightweight framework that allows people to create and share data in a way that ensures accuracy without relying on concentrated power-brokers. It’s not an application layer in and of itself, and it’s highly neutral as to the kinds of applications that are built with it. And it’s unburdened by many of the complications of web2 (where data is subject to centralized control, surveillance, censorship, and points of failure) or early web3 (where global consensus mechanisms and massive data replication result in high computing costs and slow processing).",
            "In another sense, though, Holochain is highly complex: there’s actually a lot of technology that goes into ensuring data integrity without centralized components. This is partly because Holochain is a networking system, and any networking system has to deal with many ‘states’ of data (across many computers) by either updating them all together or otherwise integrating them with one another. But it’s also because Holochain doesn’t force the network into a universally shared state (which would result in enclosure points) but rather enables massive simultaneity of perspectives.  Everyone in a Holochain application space represents their own record, yet all the records remain tamper-proof.  If that sounds like a complex challenge, you’re on the right track. It’s no wonder Holochain has only recently become ready for prime time, after years of work.",
            "And yet, nothing less complex would map to the problem space Holochain is designed to address. Global challenges are interrelated and multi-faceted in their causes and effects, so they require interrelated and multi-faceted solutions.  You can’t solve the energy crisis, pollution, deforestation, or hunger with centralized systems – or, as it turns out, with blockchain tokenization – any more than you can fix a meadow with a hammer.  Matters have gotten out of hand precisely because we have been force-fitting living systems through power-entrenching enclosure points for centuries.",
            "What is required is a radical, widespread shift away from extractive economics and toward regenerative economics, yet the power imbalances we’ve created over time perpetuate the cycle of extractive power. This is why we maintain that Holochain or something like it is a necessary foundation for saving the world.",

            "This Holochain release was a quiet rollout of a change we’ve been working on and getting excited about for a while: a new syncing strategy for rrDHT called Quantised Gossip. It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a  patent application  for it.",
            "If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.",
            "Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.",
            "But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.",
            "So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the  intro to rrDHT , the  Core Concepts article on the DHT , and this  small Dev Pulse section  about a recent change to arcs.",
            "Previously, we were using something called a  Bloom filter . It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.",
            "The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.",
            "Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.",
            "Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.",
            "[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.]  rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.",
            "There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.",

At that point it wasn’t yet operational — the required data structures were simply ready for future functionality — but now the networking layer fully supports it. ( #1472 )",
            "So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.",
            "But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘ forked ’ their chain.",
            "Enzymatic countersigning partially solves this problem. In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.",
            "Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing. Some signers can be offline and the session will still complete — as long as the enzyme is online. That’s because an enzyme is a necessary participant when optional signers are involved; they’re the one who determines exactly  which  optional signers get recorded as counterparties, so that everyone can validate the transaction in a consistent manner.",

There are also some new op helpers available in the HDI to make validation callbacks nicer to write — specifically, it gives access to the most common bits of an operation as well as your defined entry and link types, making it faster to get to the thing you actually want to validate.

Integrity zomes are the packages of code that define rules of valid behaviour in an application’s network, including the shape of public DHT data. It only gives code access to purely deterministic functions — the minimum required to get the job of validation done.",

That should make it clearer to new developers what it’s about and what it’s used for.",

It is indeed true that we didn’t bump the version number to 0.1, but the core devs did meet their target: a stable, feature-complete, relatively frozen HDI ready for course participants to start hacking on and using long-term.",

(If you doubt that accounting systems can have an impact on the world, consider how double-entry bookkeeping, with its isolated entities receiving inputs and producing outputs — its rejection of every uninteresting effect as ‘externalities’ — has caused us to overshoot our planet’s capacity to sustain us.)",

As you listen to it, pay attention to the story the musicians are telling. At first, it almost seems confused, as if they’re trying to figure out how to play with each other. The notes don’t fit quite right. Some are playing in 4/4; others in 5/4.",

Rather than give up their individual perspectives, they blend them together in an  upward spiral  of greater coherence, greater beauty. Some are still playing 4/4 and others 5/4, but their contributions only add to the richness; each individual gracefully dances with the rest of the ensemble.",
            "And I love watching their body language. The subtle glances, the smiles and grimaces, the moment-to-moment changes of bow and finger. There’s no leader to keep them all in sync, and the sheet music only gives the notes. The music comes alive because of these human signals, carrying a much higher bandwidth than conductor or ink could.",

We’re growing in our capacity to cooperate, and I think that’s an important prerequisite if we want to help the world do the same. Let’s hope that we may continue to build bridges, connect our islands, come together to create many ensemble pieces."

It’s asking me if the  first  entry in an update history should point to the newest entry (by default, an updated entry only points to its immediate replacement).",

            "I recall that there was another option offered to me, to create a by-author collection. That sounds important too; I want people to be able to drill down and only see one person’s listings.",
            "Okay, the next step is getting a bit into advanced territory. Maybe this is unnecessary for an introductory article, but I think it’s interesting to learn how to remodel things I took for granted back in my MySQL days (I told you I was old-fashioned). So we’re going to do an entry type that references another entry type (in SQL terms this would be a ‘foreign key’ relationship). It’ll be a listing ‘format’ — things like “1 pint” for a cherry tomato listing, or “packet of 20” and “bulk pack of 100” for pumpkin seeds.",
            "The first field is an entry hash, which will point to the listing we’re attaching a format to.",

            "Then it asks what sort of entry we should point to, giving us a list of already defined entry types. From there it suggests a field name — once again, it’s choosing the most sensible default to save us time.",
            "Lastly I’ll add a simple text field for the description and an integer field for the current quantity, and finish it off with CRUD functionality.",
            "You’d think I would create a collection for this, some sort of listing-to-format collection. But in this case, because I already told the scaffolder to link from the listing to the format that references it, the listing entry  is  the collection anchor for all the connected format entries.",
            "And for my final touch I’ll add a place where gardeners can introduce themselves. It’ll have just a few text fields — name, location, and bio. Of course it also needs to link to an agent ID. This is pretty similar to what we’ve seen already.",

It’s like a hApp inspector — it taps into a running conductor, which in this case is hosting the two agents whose UIs appear on the left.

            "What’s new about these two features? Let’s back up a bit and talk about what DevHub is first. It’s a package manager hApp that lets devs distribute zomes, DNAs, hApps, and UIs. It comes preinstalled in the Launcher and powers both the App Store feature and the DevHub UI. And in the future it will be integrated into the Holo suite to allow ‘hApp managers’ — either developers or people forking a hApp for their group’s personal use — to get their hApps onto HoloPorts.",
            "The original DevHub had a few DNAs that worked together as one to provide all package data — both blobs and metadata such as manifests. Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.",

            "This is a great example of a multi-DNA architecture that breaks up responsibility according to needs, abilities, and roles in the community. The  portal DNA  is a generic DNA that you can drop into your hApp to provide the bridging between a DHT of hosts and a DHT of clients. In the future, Holochain will support ‘deferred DNA provisioning’ which will eliminate the need to split this sort of functionality into two separate hApps, allowing you to bundle the host DNA and only activate it for those who want to be hosts.",

We’re nearing a stable 0.2.2 release which tackles some of the biggest performance issues, but further improvements will still come after that point.",

Even the most well-tested code is vulnerable to the kind of creative challenges the real world likes to throw at it.",

These tests exercise the conductor fairly aggressively. Even still, when we released it to the world, it struggled to keep up with real-world usage scenarios, as my colleague  Eric wrote about recently .",
            "Why did this happen? Simple: the real world is messy. It’s hard to write tests that anticipate the issues you’ll see out there. Many of them will be ‘ black swans ’ — situations that are inherently impossible to predict. For example, our automated tests didn’t anticipate the performance issues that could happen when network communication is thin and unreliable.",
            "And that, of course, is exactly the kind of situation you encounter in the real world. It turned out that, in large networks with lots of data, network latency and bandwidth caused gossip bottlenecks at unexpected moments. Aborted and restarted gossip sessions were creating race conditions, causing network connection pool saturations that took a while to clear out.",

The task now is to make it right — which is not about fixing fundamental defects but instead refactoring the code to make it easier to test.",

In order to do this, it needs to feel good to use.  In ideal situations Holochain already feels fast enough — we’ve already been using hApps like  Acorn ,  KanDo , and  TalkingStickies  for months in our daily work.  Now it’s time to make it work well in all those non-ideal situations.",

It will include fixes for a zome call timeout issue, along with various improvements they’ve already made to the networking layer. The first release candidate is  already cut , and our next step is to stress-test it with a few flagship apps before deciding if it’s ready. 0.2.2 won’t fix all possible performance issues, but it will be an incremental-yet-noticeable improvement.",

The original Holochain prototype and white paper contained sound principles – most of which survive in the new version – but people’s understanding of them slipped over time, either because they’re a bit abstract, atypical, and complex, or because we didn’t spell them out clearly enough the first time.",
            "So we began this overhaul with a  rewrite of Holochain’s formalization document , including particular attention to the places where confusion had surfaced, such as transforming local chain data to sharded global DHT data. This formal document probably isn’t for everyone, but if you are someone who thinks in more academic terms, it could be helpful."

Each workflow can only make changes to Holochain’s cryptographic state within the specific stage of work it is responsible for. Formalizing our technical architecture around these workflows allowed us to  optimize for concurrent processing  without concern that one workflow would be changing data affected by the scope of another one.",
            "Concurrency is also enhanced by causing workflows to  produce all their changes in a scratch space  and allowing them read-only access to Holochain while doing so. Then at the end of their processing, we grab a lock for a very brief,  atomic write transaction  to the data sources and flush the changes from the scratch space to the underlying tables. We also guarantee that if multiple processes are attempting to write to the source chain, only the one to finish first will succeed, requiring the others to retry their validation on top of the newly updated local state.",
            "An additional benefit of defining clear workflow boundaries is ensuring that Holochain functions “local first,” which means a Holochain app can successfully change its local state and queue those state changes for synchronization with the DHT when it has network access again. As a result, asynchronous distributed apps  can function offline  and in regions with limited internet access. Offline functionality remains out of bounds for blockchain, but it is a natural fit for Holochain’s agent-centric state model."

This lets us  reduce the number of required threads  while still optimizing for concurrency on the threads available to Holochain. However, because some actions cannot safely await a return from a future as they would tie up tokio’s threads for too long, we use tokio’s safe blocking for calling into WASM, I/O, and networking.",
            "Also, since linear logs are difficult to read in highly concurrent systems, we have switched to using the very cool  tokio-tracing logs , which  maintain calling context and sequence  to be much more easily navigated for the kind of complex synchronous actions happening in a P2P distributed framework like Holochain.",

It has evolved through a number of iterations to become a lightweight, simple-to-use actor model. We use it in a number of places – for networking, launching WASM, calling workflows from interfaces – to make  efficient and clean execution boundaries  compatible with Rust’s strict management of data lifetimes.",
            "LMDB:  We needed a  lightweight, super-fast key-value database  with unlimited connections for simultaneous read access for Holochain’s Content-Addressable Store (CAS). We chose Mozilla’s  rkv  wrapper for  Lightning Memory-mapped DataBase (LMDB)  as the best fit for this stage. Cascading State Engine for Content Addressable Storage (CAS):  We invested quite a lot of energy in wrapping some formalizations around the LMDB databases to provide consistent methods for workflows to interact with Holochain’s cryptographic state.",

This lets us  constrain the scope of changes  workflows can make, and it lets us have a  consistent “finishing” process  at the end of their work.",
                "Cascading Queries :  When a `get(<hash>)` command is called from within a workflow, we cascade through consistent layers of database queries to return the result, including (1) the workspace’s scratch space, (2) the local CAS (holding authored headers/entries to one’s source chain as well as the headers/entries in one’s shard of the DHT), (3) a local cache of data previously requested from the network, and (4) authorized nodes on the DHT via the network. This cascade  enables workflows to reuse data  that may have been loaded or cached by other workflows, as well as  increases responsiveness and performance , while  shielding the workflows from the complexity  of interacting with these layers."

In this transition, we also changed a great deal of how everything interfaces at the Holochain/WASM boundary. These changes are too numerous and too detailed to be worth naming here, but the upshot is that they have enabled  faster calls, better memory management, and much higher memory safety/security . Now, direct calls are simple enough that we can expose them as an API to the Holochain system (more about that in the HDK section below).",
            "WASM Caching:  In order to reduce load time for hApps running in WASM – now to under a tenth of millisecond, a >1,000x improvement – we set up a WASM cache and restructured our DNA entries in source chains to reference the hash of a chunk of web assembly, rather than storing the web assembly itself in the chain. We can still guarantee hashed integrity of the application code, but now we have  much faster load times  and can  share cached WASM  across multiple locally-installed instances of an app’s DNA. This is especially great for Holo hosts who may be running many copies of an app. Serialized Bytes vs. JSON:  The previous version of Holochain used JSON for crossing boundaries between Holochain and other subsystems (WASM, UI interfaces, networkint, etc.). But serializing, deserializing, and parsing JSON is notoriously inefficient, and it can lead to issues with double serialization and hellishly confusing payloads characterized by many layers of backslashed quotation marks. We’ve  standardized interchange across all of these boundaries  with a new binary format that still leverages existing standards (using  MessagePack ) but is  type-safe, consistent, and many times faster ."

            "Although it was technically possible to make direct system calls in the previous version of Holochain, it was so complex and required so many lines of semi-boilerplate code that we didn’t even publish info about how to do it. We also identified some memory-management vulnerabilities in passing data back and forth to the WASM guest processes running inside Holochain’s host process. In Holochain RSM we were able to create a very efficient method of passing closures which also ensures secure memory handling. As a result, bypassing the HDK when needed to make a direct API call can now be accomplished with just a few lines, in contrast with the previous API, which took about 30 times more code as well as some difficult memory management. We are all thrilled to have optimized this into such a usable and maintainable form."

Most developers will prefer the HDK format, and we are hearing reports that it has  shortened app code to about one-third compared to HDK 2.0 . We have also streamlined syntax for consistency, such as by structuring all the function calls in verb-noun format and using standard CRUD terms for data operations (Create, Update, Delete).",
            "As you can see in the partial HDK snapshot below, the codebase is thoroughly self-documenting through Rust crate document generation. However, we aren’t publishing to crates.io until we resolve some namespace conflicts with the old version of Holochain, so until then you’ll need to generate them locally using the `cargo doc --open` command.",
            "Working with Elements, not just Entries: All data in Holochain originates in someone’s source chain as a chunk of content, known as an entry, along with a header that chains the entry to all previous data by pointing to the previous header. Headers also contain important metadata about the entry such as its hash, a timestamp, the author’s key, the author’s signature, etc. In Holochain RSM, an entry plus its header are called an Element. When you `get()` data from the DHT, the result is not just the entry content, but a  header-entry pair , which  automatically includes the timestamp, author’s ID, and author’s signature .",
            "Update and Delete operations now also reference Elements instead of just the entry. This  eliminates ambiguity and prevents the “update loops”  in the DHT modifications that people experienced in the prior version of Holochain.",
            "Changes to Headers:   The largest change to internal data structures in this version of Holochain is a shift in the importance of headers. Previously, each new addition to a source chain was a header-entry pair. The header tied the new entry into the chain by referencing the entry hash and created the chaining effect by referencing the hash of the previous header. In the new version of Holochain, we’ve made header structures more sophisticated such that the  system data is embedded directly in the header , meaning that all system-defined entries – except for agent keys and private entries such as capabilities grants – no longer need entries at all.",
            "This change may seem trivial, but it significantly alters the structure of local chains as well as increases overall performance. For every entry integrated into its header, Holochain no longer needs to publish and gossip  two  items to the DHT (header & entry) but now just one (just the header with embedded data). This  cuts the amount of gossip and validation that the network needs to perform in half,  allowing for even faster performance and state consistency.",
            "Another aspect of this structural change is that headers, rather than entries, are signed. This fixes a security vulnerability which could have allowed an actor to counterfeit broken headers. It also means that if your app currently inspects signed provenances in headers, you will need to have it reference the multiple signed headers for the entry instead.",
            "Entry Definitions: Beyond the app-defined fields in the struct of an entry, entry definitions now require some additional fields such as visibility (public/private) and num_validation_receipts (how many validation receipts are required to build a receipt bundle).",
            "Link Definitions: The data structure for links is already defined by the Holochain system, so you can simply leverage that structure by using the create_link() HDK function. Each zome simply needs a unified validate_link() callback which can match on the link contents. The underlying API has unified the link “type” and “tag” fields, but the HDK still separates those out as distinct parameters.",
            "Validation Callbacks : Holochain now provides a unified callback system which enables you to define familiar callbacks (such as zome initialization, entry validation, custom validation package construction, etc.) which will only call into WASM if they’ve been defined. Also, these calls are automatically tried based on  a layered approach starting with the most specific match and falling through to more general  conditions. For example, you could define default validation code for your app’s entry types to allow only the original author to update/edit it. The callback system would then check first by action (create, update, delete) for the specific entry type, but if the validation code has not been defined for that entry type, it will fall back to the general action case for all entry types.",
            "Many New Callbacks:   Have you ever wished you could put a hook inside Holochain’s workflows so that every time a new entry is created, you could call a fulltext indexing process? Well, now you can by creating a Post-Commit callback for that entry type. And that’s just one of many new callbacks available to provide  more nuanced triggers in Holochain’s underlying workflows .",
            "Capabilities-Based Security Model:  Prior versions of Holochain never quite fully implemented the capabilities security we had intended. Now it has. The new Holochain confirms cryptographic source and permissions by checking for explicit capabilities on whatever function is being called  before  spinning up WASM to call your app code.  Security is enforced on all calls and connections  whether via local UI connections, remote UI connections, or remote calls from other nodes.",
            "Remote Call:   Holochain has always contained a direct messaging protocol between nodes, but instead of implementing it as send/receive as we did previously, we have now made it simply a `remote_call()` function. You can still easily implement a send and a receive to mimic prior functionality, but now you can expand your app’s options to  enable the possibility of calling into any zome function from another node . This lets you leverage Holochain’s unified, capabilities-based security model to do cool things like allowing my assistant to schedule directly in my calendar app (writing to my source chain on my behalf) because I’ve explicitly granted that capability.",
            "More System Calls:  Based on requests from our user community, we’ve added a number of system calls to the HDK for functions like  random number generation ,  creating UUIDs , and  generating timestamps  from local system time. We have some more HDK function requests under review in our pipeline.",
            "Native Support for Countersigning:   While all changes in Holochain are changes to  local  state on someone’s source chain, some events involve multiple agents agreeing to coordinate simultaneous changes to their state (such as currency transactions: my account goes down by 10 credits while yours goes up 10 credits). It’s important that such actions be bound together as a kind of single atomic event. Previously, applications managed this process by having all parties countersign a single identical entry to each of their chains, and provide the other parties with their signed header as proof of the action.",
            "While that’s still possible through a series of remote function calls between the parties, doing so requires an advanced understanding of the workings of Holochain, and it can get particularly complicated if the parties are not online at the same time. We are dramatically simplifying this process by adding native support to Holochain for countersigning entries. There will be a ‘countersigner’ data type, and when you define fields in one of your entries using this type,  Holochain will manage the process of gathering the signatures  of all the parties for you."

So we’ve taken steps to  reduce the number of times Holochain has to spin up WASM  by making some of what is defined in the application code available to Holochain outside of WASM. For example, all publicly exposed zome call functions, including the wide variety of callbacks that can be defined, are revealed so that Holochain can determine whether to call back into WASM without having to spin it up to make that determination. Also, the entry types are available along with their ‘validation_package’ formats, which enables any node needing to perform DHT validation to avoid a network call as well as a WASM call, if it can determine using native Rust calls that it already possesses the required validation data.",
            "Native-compiled WASM Performance:  Even web assembly that’s executed via an interpreter is usually much faster than JavaScript. But interpreted code, such as with wasmi, is still much slower than natively compiled code. Wasmer enables Holochain to take WASM code that is distributed in a Holochain application package and recompile it to  run as native binary code that executes approximately 1,000 times faster than interpreted bytecode . Holochain compiles the code when you install the app (after confirming all the hashes on the WASM code). It also  manages a memory cache  for the compiled code for ultra-fast execution. To ensure the compiled code hasn’t been tampered with we can recompile from the hashed WASM code at random intervals.",
            "Initial Benchmarking:  We currently see calls to app functions execute in wasmer in under 0.1 milliseconds, compared to 100 to 200 milliseconds for function calls through wasmi in the prior version of Holochain. That’s a  speed improvement of 1,000x to 2,000x . I had wanted to display some nice performance graphs, but the execution times in the new version are so much faster that the figures don’t even show on the graphs for comparison."

Because QUIC uses UDP, it can process  multiple simultaneous bidirectional exchanges , eliminating “head-of-line blocking” in which small messages get stuck waiting for larger ones ahead of them to finish. Furthermore, after the initial TLS handshake between two peers, future encrypted  connections require zero setup time .",
            "Under good network conditions, QUIC shows speeds similar to TCP/IP, but on congested or unreliable connections  QUIC outperforms TCP/IP by filling gaps in lost segments of data faster . This means QUIC has advantages on wireless connections (both WiFi and cellular) which often suffer from this kind of packet loss and also constitute the vast majority of end-user Internet connections these days.",

And Google has ensured widespread adoption of QUIC – so much so that the emerging HTTP/3 standard is built on it. As a result, we’re able to  leverage existing code libraries for both TLS and QUIC  and keep our development focus on data integrity and efficient, complete gossip. It also provides assurance for our users that we aren’t introducing errors or vulnerabilities by building our own crypto communication protocols.",
            "Reduced Network Calls:  As mentioned above in the section describing cascading queries, Holochain RSM has implemented a  caching layer to reduce the need to query the network for recently seen data . Caching makes particular sense in a DHT/content-addressable space because, if you're retrieving content based on its hash, the content is the same as when you last saw it. Only metadata and links may have changed, and we can perform a lazy network get on that data after providing a quick cached response to the UI – and then update the UI again from the network results. In many cases this delivers a  user experience as responsive as a local database , making the Holochain app experience not only much faster than lethargic blockchain consensus systems but actually  faster than centralized web servers . Also, since the cache layer only holds data shared publicly on the DHT, it is safe for multiple instances of an app to share the cache; this will result in massive speed-ups for Holo hosts who may be running many instances of an app for different users.",
            "Hyper-Efficient Network Representation:  DHTs can be chaotic and complex under any condition; add in the properties of gossiping and self-healing and it can become especially challenging to parsimoniously represent the state of the system and who is responsible for what. You may have heard that the prior version of Holochain had some issues with discrepancies between the data that nodes tracked in their hold lists and the data that the network represented as being held by the nodes. In Holochain RSM, data representation has been massively simplified in rrDHT such that  a node represents the range of addresses it is responsible for with a single 32-bit integer . Now, if you know the address of the node and its arc range, you know exactly what range of addresses you can ask it for. This simplifies the codebase and architecture significantly, while providing performance characteristics on par with complex, binary-tree representations of the DHT space.",
            "Integrated Keystore:  Holochain’s new keystore stores the private/public keypair not only for agent keys for Holochain apps, but also for the TLS keys used for network connections. And when network transport addresses and TLS keys are published to peer routing tables, they are signed by the agent keys to ensure that nodes are always reaching the endpoint that controls the private key of their targeted agent. These protocols  make Holochain peer communications   immune to man-in-the-middle attacks .",
            "Prepared to Go Full P2P:  Fully decentralized systems can be notoriously hard to test. While developing the prior version of Holochain, we used a central switchboard (sim2h) while we were debugging network coordination and connection issues. We’ve upgraded the process in Holochain RSM by having  each node maintain a peer routing table and contact peers directly  using the transport addresses the target node has published. Nodes that don’t expose a public IP and port  (mainly behind NAT or firewalls) can use a relay that can be reached via a public IP address with which they maintain a connection, and publish in the peer routing table that they can be reached via that relay. Initially, for easy troubleshooting, we’ll have every node publish their address via a single relay proxy; the end-to-end TLS encryption ensures the relay can’t read any of the traffic. Then when it comes time to go fully peer-to-peer, all the nodes need to do is publish their own public IP or, if they don’t have one, choose a relay proxy they trust."

It’s like water scooped into a bucket: when you scoop some out, you don’t know which inbound scoop of water the molecules you’re getting came from.",

This means that every piece of data, including every token, is  inherently  unique – the data itself plus its source information – so no additional code is required to keep instances of data distinct from one another. Thus,  an NFT on Holochain is an extraordinarily simple application: it’s just a transfer protocol, a means of assigning the token from one person to another.",

We  wrote previously  about how blockchain’s need to reach global consensus results in substantial costs (usually called gas fees), transaction delays, ecological impact, and other inefficiency challenges. With NFTs this is even more the case, since blockchain NFTs are  particularly energy-intensive  relative to ordinary transacting. Plus, as with all blockchain smart contracts, nodes are required to retain all transaction data forever, so there’s a hefty storage cost in addition to computing cost. And that’s to say nothing of storing the  actual digital works  that NFTs often represent."

Sure, there’s a case for saying the answer is yes – after all, that’s sort of what money is – but wouldn’t it be better if it were possible to buy and sell the  actual unique digital file  along with the NFT? Then there’s just no question.",

The record representing the file’s ownership is made visible to the network, along with maybe a thumbnail of the image, but the file itself does not need to be published, even as the two are inextricably linked. This way, an artist can create a digital asset that is truly unique (or limited to a certain number of ‘prints’).  When an NFT is signed over to a new owner, the actual file can get sent along with it, without sharing a copy with the world, similar to transferring a physical art piece.",

For digital works the mechanism is reasonably reliable: a unique ‘hash’, or fingerprint, of the digital file is created and stored as part of the token. But for non-digital works, the mechanism breaks down. There’s no way to be sure that the NFT you’re buying is the NFT that corresponds to the piece of land, the boat, or the painting in question. It’s a version of blockchain’s oracle problem: with everyone being anonymous and no central authority, it’s virtually impossible to incorporate real-world events (such as the creation of a painting) into on-chain events (such as designating a token to uniquely represent the painting). For this reason, blockchain-based NFTs have so far focused on digital works only – quite a major limitation.",

Holochain’s provenance means that it’s always evident  who  created the NFT; its creation is digitally signed by the creator’s private keys.

Of course you might have some real-world homework to make sure that the MOMA was the rightful owner of the painting at the time of the NFT’s creation, but records already exist for that, and in any case it’s a much smaller problem than one in which anyone can anonymously create an NFT claiming to represent the painting.",

            "More broadly, provenance around custody is a version of provenance around information: we  wrote previously  about the idea of a Holochain-powered  verified web , in which signal (accurate information) is discernible from noise (potential disinformation) because no one can ever claim something was said that wasn’t, or claim something wasn’t said that was.",
            "It might seem like a stretch to categorize provenance of  all  information on Holochain, property-related or otherwise, as a version of ‘NFTs’. But, from a technical standpoint, it’s actually not. Every communication and transaction on Holochain, whether it’s sending money, transferring property rights, or ordering a sandwich, is inherently non-fungible because data is always associated with stamps of time and authorship. This makes every entry of data, effectively, a unique token. Thus, Holochain isn’t just an ideal framework  for  NFTs; it builds the properties everyone wants from NFTs into  everything.  From a Holochain vantage point in which all data is already unique, the very idea of  making  data unique, which is what blockchain NFTs jump through hoops to try to do, may begin to seem like an artifact."

We even thought about building it ourselves just to show how easily it can be done… but then we thought a better idea would be to put it out there to our developer community, since there’s a real opportunity here. If you’ve been wanting a tech business idea for a proven concept with a large addressable market and multiple advantages over the competition, now you have one.",

Users will value owning their own data and having control over their identity and keys – features which are not only native to Holochain’s infrastructure but also guaranteed by Holochain’s  Cryptographic Autonomy License .",

Alternatively, documents could be stored only on user source chains for an ultra-high degree of privacy not possible in centralized or blockchain scenarios.",

            "Before modern technology, or really before the development of written language, communication was generally transmitted by unenclosable carrier. Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.",
            "The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.",
            "And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast.  The ability to control the carrier results in the ability to control the message."

You  can  stop someone from speaking up around a fire if you physically attack them or try to shout over them. But then everyone knows you’re doing that, which means that your actions are subject to whatever social feedback mechanisms exist to temper abuses of power. So, really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is  covert  power. The manager filtering the suggestion box; the allocation of FM bandwidth to someone over someone else; the private understandings between interest groups and politicians."

In newsprint and on television, it’s the advertisers, as well as executives who are bound to the interests of boards and shareholders, who exert (largely unseen) control over the content we receive. Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.",
            "And of course we have the internet, which has given us a taste of radical participation and democratized access to information, but whose filters on access and information have begun to cause increasing alarm. There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote. And, of course, Google steers you to some web sites over others, according to its secret algorithms.",

If you’re a participant in this ecosystem, you might be thinking that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, at least the ‘best’ ones, are precisely the antidote to the problem of carrier enclosability.",
            "It’s true that blockchain applications have, in many cases at least, offered an exciting means of collaborating outside the reach of outsized government and corporate middlemen. But how unenclosable are they really? Blockchain protocols all rely on some mechanism of  global consensus  to determine which transactions are considered legitimate enough to be added to the shared record. This means that many  nodes  – computers on a given network – must agree with one another before officially adopting any information, then storing it as a  global state , meaning that all nodes hold  all  the same data. It’s an understandable approach: replicating data globally might seem like the only way to coordinate at scale without being subject to centralized authority or being susceptible to data-tampering.",
            "One problem with this approach, though, is that global consensus mechanisms turn out to be a form of carrier enclosure, since they necessarily give power to some people over others to determine the legitimacy of transactions. Ordinary users like you and me do not write directly to the blockchain, nor do we participate in the consensus mechanism that results in data being written to the blockchain. We defer to miners and stakers do those things on our behalf, and in doing so we turn over our authority to them to say what’s written to the record.",
            "What’s more, not all miners and stakers have equal power. In proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, those who own more computing resources have more say. In proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which have become more popular in recent years, those who put up more money as betting stakes have more say. The more computing resources or the more betting stakes you own, the more money you make, which earns you the ability to buy more of those things. Thus, both protocols have a rich-get-richer effect and converge toward greater and greater consolidation of wealth and power over time.",
            "Even  more  carrier enclosure has resulted from blockchain’s attempts to  solve  its efficiency problems. It turns out that achieving global consensus and managing global state require a tremendous amount of processing power and storage capacity, resulting in wait times and fees for every transaction, as well as  posing an obstacle to blockchain’s ability to scale to the needs of real-world challenges . Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions channel control through an increasingly narrow club of authorized representatives who are empowered to accept (or refuse) our transaction.",
            "And real communication enclosures can happen and  have  happened in blockchain projects. The  Ethereum hard fork in 2016 , right-minded as it may have been, was a means of invalidating transactions that had occurred. EOS has also  reversed transactions , as has  Bitcoin Cash .",
            "So, even though the very intention of many blockchain projects is to address intermediation and the centralization of power, they are actually subject to the same kinds of power imbalances we see in other mediums. It’s a tilted playing field, and even a slightly tilted playing field results in a  self-reinforcing feedback loop  that eventually leads to massive wealth imbalances – which is a fair narrative for what’s happened in economies around the world over the course of the last 500 years.",
            "So we’re back to our original question: is it possible to have a system of communicating and transacting that 1) is truly unenclosable and 2) is capable of massive scale?"

          "content": [
            "In considering how a communication system might be both unenclosable and scalable, let’s look at the evolution of language itself. How does language arise? Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.",
            "So, a new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself. We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.",
            "This does  not  mean an absence of rules. Protocols are essential within any given space for filtering signal from noise, and to avoid the gaming of that space. People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.",
            "So, one key ingredient in making any system fundamentally unenclosable is  free association: the ability for anyone to create segmented spaces that people can join or not , with rulesets that are particular to those spaces. An unenclosable version of Wikipedia would be free of the centralized servers that host the data today, but it would still have protocols that say how articles are written. An unenclosable version of Twitter would still have a character limit. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to be able to post a tweet on Wikipedia or an encyclopedic article on Twitter. Within the scope of each app, people are free to express themselves according to the parameters they opted into when joining the app.",
            "Many apps will even need to have centralized aspects of control, such as moderation by individuals or groups. But if the underlying  carrier system  is unenclosable, everyone owns and controls their own data (versus having it held in centralized or third-party enclosure points), so everyone always has the option of leaving the application space for any reason, including if they don’t like some new rule or the way the space is being moderated.",
            "Which leads us to another fundamental aspect of an unenclosable system:  forkability, which is the freedom for anyone to spin up alternative application spaces,  based on the same (or similar) source codes and rulesets, and invite people to the new version. For true forkability, users need to be able to migrate easily between versions, taking their data from one version — such as their complete activity history on a social network or search engine — and load it into the new version. This is, of course, very much not the case with the likes of today’s Facebook and Google, who own and control your data, making only a fraction of it available to you."

To return to the island analogy again: if people can move freely between islands, bringing language patterns from one to the other, the dialects that are most suitable to people’s needs will be the ones that thrive and spread."

            "If you've been following the Holochain/Holo story at all, you've probably heard that Holochain is \"agent centric\". Strictly speaking this is true, but unfortunately it has hidden a deeper truth about Holochain. Let me explain: we used the term * agent-centric * to distinguish Holochain from other software architectures (especially in the blockchain world) that are philosophically * data-centric *. The prime concern of blockchain ledgers is to create a single \"consensus\" view on a data reality in the distributed peer-to-peer world, where that's a known hard problem. In the case of Bitcoin, the idea is to create a data reality of the location of digital coins: who spent them and with whom. In the case of Ethereum, the idea is to create a data reality of not just coin locations, but also the state of a global computer that you can write and run programs on, i.e. \"smart-contracts\".",
            "The reason creating these data realities is a hard problem in the decentralized network world is that it's impossible to determine the absolute ordering of events. This is a simple fact of physics. In the client–server paradigm this isn’t even a problem, because we start from a centralized server where there is a canonical notion of what the data is and a canonical time. The central server stores the data reality. The brilliance of blockchain is that it provides a protocol for distributed peers to hold data reality together, be it the order of transaction of Bitcoins, or the ordering of computation steps on Ethereum. But it does this by enforcing a single ordering of events. The stupidity of blockchain is that the protocol it uses to enforce this single ordering of events is incredibly expensive, extremely wasteful of computation power, and generates obscene amounts of greenhouse gases. On top of all that, for almost all distributed collaborative applications it's not even necessary to keep one single global ordering of events. It’s easy to make this mistake of thinking so if your purpose is a trustless system that’s trying to track the location of digital coins, but it turns out that you can still solve that same problem a different way.",
            "Enter Holochain. The ** agent-centric ** view point starts from the understanding that data is derived from agency. It does not have “primary” ontological status.",
            "Data is essentially and fundamentally a record of a particular agent’s experience, be that a human, a sensor, or a device. In reality, agents see/sense/detect different things and receive feedback in different orders representing different realities. If any record’s provenance is separated from it, then the “data” represented by that record is fundamentally broken. We can only make sense of data if we know who sensed the data. This is why absolute ordering of massively simultaneous computation is impossible.",
            "But herein lies the \"unfortunate\" part that I mentioned before. I have seen people jumping on Holochain's agent-centricity as if it were an ideological stance about the supremacy of individual rights. It is true that the agent-centric approach will help achieve some crucial goals in individual rights, especially around privacy, and preventing inappropriately centralized entities (corporate or governmental) from abusing data privilege. But this is only the first part of the story.",
            "A Holochain application's architecture is better described as ** collaboration-centric **. Start with the reality of agency. Don't dis-empower these agents. Instead fully empower them to enter into non-coercive play together with agreed upon rule-sets. Then what you get is thrivable social-coherence. This is what Holochain is designed to embody. And it's working!",

            "Point #2 probably ought not be controversial as indicated by the prevalence of git in software development, but it might need a little explanation for those readers that don’t do team coding and therefore aren’t making code commits and branching, forking, and merging many times a day. Even for those of you who are, if you grew up doing so always with your git repos centralized on GitHub, you may be missing a key part of the decentralization story.",
            "For me, the first time I understood what distributed software and peer-to-peer really meant as an architectural reality was when I switched from Subversion to Git for version control. Subversion was based on the mental model of a centralized repository (a database of changes to the code’s text files) from which coders would 1) make local check-outs of that source code 2) edit the files, 3) and then make a commit (which is storing back into the database a set of such changes), but 4) you might have to merge your changes before you could make the commit if someone else had committed first, which entailed resolving any conflicting changes. Coders could also make a branch (which was a copy of the repository) and create a bunch of commits on that branch and merge those in too, but the mental model was still of some central place with a single “canonical” reality that the group of coders was updating.",
            "Git was different. Git assumes no center point. It assumes that each coder has their own copy of the code repository and can pull and push changes to any other distributed copy of the repo they have permission to access. It assumes that all changes are made to local branches and that branches will be created and merged all the time. It embraces locally divergent realities and eventual group consistency.",
            "If you think that your git repository on GitHub is somehow special, well from git’s perspective it isn’t. It’s just a repo that a bunch of agents have agreed to use in a hub-and-spoke synchronization pattern. Your “git push” could be directly to your friends repos if they gave you access and you added them as a remote. In that case you would just be agreeing to a more mesh-like collaboration pattern.",
            "Of course github has loaded lots of collaboration value-add on top of just being a place to embody the hub-and-spoke pattern, with issues, pull requests, kan-ban boards, integrated CI, etc. This is an important part of the story which is part of a pattern that repeats: decentralized public-domain protocols spawn centralized proprietary value-add silos built on top of those protocols. The detailed story of another example of this—about how AOL, GEnie, and Prodigy created chat-rooms, news services and all kinds of proprietary value-add on top of the primary feature of the internet’s SMTP protocol that provided the core service, email—is one I will tell some other time. But the key there is that proprietary value-add was erased by the arrival of another set of open protocols: http and HTML. And I think that Holochain/Syn may be yet another example of this story of the orders-of-magnitude value level-up that happens in this evolutionary process.",
            "I’ll show how in a bit, but first it’s important to understand what it takes to build Syn apps. To make a Syn app you have to do just a few things:",

              "lists": [
                "Define a  state model  that represents your application. In the case of a text document this state model might be just two strings, the title and the document body.",

                "Create a  delta function  which, given a state and a transformation, produces a new state. This is  pretty easy to do  with simple patch grammars.",
                "Create a  UI  that: a. renders the state when it gets notified that the state has changed, and b. creates Syn transformations when the user would like to make a change."
              ]
            },
            "Once you’ve done that, Syn takes care of the heavy lifting of coordinating between all the agents making and  syn chronizing changes, all without a central server.",
            "That’s aspect 1 from the consequences of collaboration software above:real-time multi-user collaboration. With one additional app-design task, Syn’s architecture also handles aspect 2, Alignment of multiple realities, in a general way:",
            "5. Define a  merge strategy  for resolving differences between states and transformation sets.",
            "This last task is where things get tricky to do well, and in general can’t always be done in a fully automated way. However, the idea is that when necessary, a merge strategy would include human intervention: manually (i.e. using human judgement) resolving the differences between conflicting change sets. This is nothing new to git users who handle merge conflicts all the time! Note that it’s important that merge strategy is not generalized and specified per-app. This is part of the power of the Syn approach.",
            "Once this fifth task is done, Syn becomes a general framework for adding branching and merging to any collaborative app. At any given time, Syn has the notion of a session, which is just like a branch in git. It’s a commit to treat as a starting point for a series of changes. Unlike Google Docs which just has a single revision history, Syn provides, at the low level, a space for multiple version histories based simply on which session users join and start making changes. With merging, the realities these branches represent can become aligned. Because Syn supports generalized UI for creating/viewing/switching sessions and can insert the merging strategy defined by the particular app, this is a powerful pattern that used to be available only to coders using git. Now, suddenly, it can be applied to arbitrary collaboration apps. In a way, it’s two-level collaboration, synchronously on the “same” state, and asynchronously on divergent/convergent state.",
            "To me this is a big deal. If collaboration is about empowered agents entering into non-coercive playing together by agreed upon rule-sets, then this pattern in Syn is a massive level up meta-rule-set for doing so.",
            "Imagine Wikipedia articles with multiple branches that reflect the true differences we have rather than just being fights in the talk pages, frozen around the assumption that there is a single, neutral point-of-view. And because of their many branches, they can actually merge when people find a way to represent those divergences in ways that can be understood by those who were arguing. That’s next-level collaboration.",
            "Imagine creating branched spreadsheets where each branch models entirely different scenarios off of a core set of assumptions that can then get merged together as reality shows us what happens. That’s next level collaboration.",
            "Imagine the concrete vocabulary of conflict resolution that emerges as we develop new and interesting merge strategies for conflicting change sets in different application contexts. What does it mean to resolve two different color choices applied to the same object by different people in a drawing program? I can imagine an ad-hoc Syn app spinning up that lets people on the fly make proposals and vote, or do rock-paper-scissors, or whatever… all as part of resolving a merge conflict in another Syn app! That’s next level collaboration.",

It's because, with blockchain,  there is no meaningful relationship between useful work and energy consumption .

It can only serve a constant number of users, no matter how popular it gets.",

It's not the number of users, but the price of its currency. As the price increase, more people want a share of the earnings, so they start mining. And that increased price makes it more attractive to attacks, so in a strangely elegant way the security increases with the vulnerability. But this isn't the sort of performance/cost relationship we're hoping for when we talk about scaling. And, as I'm explaining, it isn't that good for the planet either.)"

We won’t speak about this too much right now because identity is such a huge topic and we have separate updates about that coming, but it was encouraging to see a dev, new to the framework, who was thinking about a lot of the same things we have been.",

He came to this training with the express intent of integrating Holochain into GO’s Meta Modeler so that it is possible to generate custom Holochain applications in a low code environment. Customizable Holochain applications that anyone can build and publish without needing years of developer experience? Yes please. We’ll definitely keep you up to date as these projects progress. There was also a crop of projects focused on financial applications. Joshua Vial and Nicholas Stebbings designed the fundamentals of an app that would make it easy to bootstrap an authority list, based on social trust structures, that would serve to authenticate cross chain and cross DHT transactions, ensuring that ledgers on both sides of an exchange were updated appropriately. Meanwhile Julien Lucca, Ross Eyre, Ché Coelho, and Leo Proechel worked on a credit clearing algorithm that uses agent-centric methods to find debt cycles in B2B contexts and cancel them out. Even the course instructor Marcus Philips spent time refining the design for a protocol he started for a Transitive Favor Network. This would be a radically peer-to-peer currency protocol where each individual would only need agreed-on systems of value exchange with their direct neighbors, but which would allow strangers to still exchange with each other by finding connections through the social graph.",

A few years back the  contract  between  Spotify and Sony was made public , and it demonstrated that, despite all the laws in place to protect publishers and artists, agreements can be written to bolster the profits of labels instead.

But many artists have found their bread and butter to be performing and giving fans intimate access to their creative processes. This new form of engagement or interaction was first seen in some of the centralised platforms for musicians. Starting as far back as MySpace and then Bandcamp and other services, artists began having more direct interaction with their fans online. This took a leap with interactive live streams during the lockdowns when in person events were essentially cancelled making earning a living excruciatingly difficult for performers."

You’ll note that I’m now listing the  previously announced  HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate as a separate thing — this library has only existed as part of the HDK before this release, but it becomes a separate thing from now on.",
            "I have to admit that the title of this Dev Pulse is not exactly true. As you may know, data integrity is critical when groups of people want to coordinate their actions. If you can’t trust what your peers are saying and doing, you can’t move forward safely with them.",
            "Also, when I say ‘coordination’ I’m not even talking about that kind of coordination. I’m talking about something more low-level and programmer-ish: one application instance coordinating the flow of its own processing and data, nothing more.",
            "And finally, they’re not really parting ways — it’s just that the pieces of your hApp’s code that are responsible for data integrity  will be split  from the pieces that are responsible for application execution. They’ll exist in separate zomes in your DNA. If you’re familiar with the MVC (model, view, controller) programming pattern, you could look at it this way:",
            "Your application’s  integrity zomes  comprise its  model layer  — everything that defines the shape of the data. In practice, this means three things: entry type definitions, link type definitions, and a validation callback that constrains the kinds of data that can validly be called entries and links of those types.",
            "And the  coordination zomes  comprise its  controller layer  — the code that actually commits data, retrieves it, handles countersigning sessions, and sends and receives messages between peers or between a cell and its UI. In other words, all your zome functions, your `init` functions, your remote signal receivers, and your scheduler callbacks will all live in coordination zomes.",
            "To repeat what I described a few months ago, the intention is to  let you split  the core integrity components of your application, which define the unalterable rules of the game, from the business logic. That way, your DHT can last a long time yet still receive upgrades and bug fixes — as long as you don’t need to change your integrity components.",
            "And we’re making the same promise for the reduced library that your integrity components are built on — the HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate. Once it reaches its 0.1.0 release, we plan to keep HDI stable for a while between minor releases.",
            "You’re probably wondering how to refactor your hApp given this substantial change. Here are the most important things to know:",
            "Your DNA manifest file is broken into  integrity  and  coordinator  sections.   integrity  holds everything that affects the DNA’s hash: the list of integrity zomes, the DNA properties, the UID, and a new  origin_time  field that indicates the earliest possible timestamp for a source chain entry, which is used to prevent time-travel attacks.  Only the  integrity  section affects your DNA hash.",
            "coordinator  holds the list of coordination zomes. Coordination zomes must explicitly list their dependencies; that is, the integrity zomes that contain definitions for the entry and link types they intend to write. (If you have only one integrity zome, however, you don’t need to list it as a dependency in any of the coordination zomes.) Here’s a complex example with multiple zomes of both kinds:",
            "As mentioned, your  entry/link definitions, membrane proof self-checks, and validation callbacks will need to be moved into integrity zomes  with only one core dependency on the HDI crate  holochain_deterministic_integrity . This crate has been around for a while, but you haven’t needed to worry about it until now because it was just part of the HDK. (It still is, but it now is meant to exist independently of the HDK.) integrity zomes should not depend on the full HDK — it’s not going to remain stable over time like HDI is. There are new macro helpers for defining entry and link types. The test suite has examples of an integrity zome with  entry types  and  link types .",
            "All of your  zome functions, init callbacks, remote signal receivers, and scheduler callbacks should go into coordination zomes . They can (and likely should) depend on the full HDK, which still includes  holochain_deterministic_integrity  as a dependency.",
            "Only the coordination zomes can use non-deterministic host functions in the full HDK such as source chain commits and queries, DHT gets, agent activity queries, signal emitters, remote calls, and complex crypto functions. Integrity zomes can only use deterministic functions such as  must_get_* ,  dna_info ,  zome_info , and simple crypto functions such as hashing. This makes sense, because the only functions available to your validation callback are the deterministic ones; this just becomes explicit with the separation between HDI and the rest of the HDK.",
            "There are some changes that remove  zome_id  from the headers of entry and link creation elements. These changes are temporary and will be  reverted  in a future release . In fact, before the 0.1.0 release of HDI there will likely be  more changes , although they will mostly be hidden behind macros and other conveniences. If you want to have a say in the usability of the hApp development experience, please jump in now and tell us what you think. But if you desire stability, it’s probably best to wait until 0.1.0.",

We believe these language changes will make it easier for new developers to understand what these structures are about. Every source chain commit is a record of a particular type of action (publishing an agent key, creating data, deleting a link, etc), so this language aligns with that reality.  Entry  is remaining the same. ( #1441 )",
                "Breaking:  When you’re using an ‘enzyme’ in countersigning (a trusted agent who collects all the signatures, rather than waiting for signatures to get published to the DHT and broadcast to all signers), you now specify that a session  is enzymatic , and the enzyme agent will be the first countersigner by convention. Previously the enzyme's agent ID was specified explicitly and separately from the other counterparties. ( Note:  the API is fully fleshed out, but the network plumbing to support enzymes is not functional yet.) ( #1394 )",
                "Breaking:  In a countersigning session, you can now specify a number of  optional signers . You can specify how many of them  must  sign  in order for the session to complete; that number must be equal to or greater than a majority of the optional signers. This is useful for reaching ‘micro-consensus’ over rivalrous data such as usernames, in a way that tolerates downtime among trusted authorities.  Note:  When using optional witnesses, the session  must  use an enzyme, who must be the first agent in both the list of signing agents and the list of optional signers. This allows the process to be more efficient and less ambiguous than waiting for the DHT to reach consistency. ( #1394 )"

            "I was there partly to learn more about Marcus’ unique educational approach. As co-founder of Hack Reactor, he’s had a lot of opportunities to learn what works and what doesn’t. And what he’s discovered is that you can understand any complex subject if you break it down into bite-sized pieces that build on pieces you already understand. The goal is to find the shortest path through an infinite landscape of ideas, building each idea upon the last. Sounds pretty obvious, but it’s an art — it’s hard to design a curriculum that does this well. (On some nights I glimpsed the curriculum team furiously refining the next day’s slides, trying to get them just a little bit more elegant and digestible.)",

            },
            "I found rule 1 particularly compelling. It naturally leads to the bite-sized pieces approach I mentioned before. The curriculum team — Marcus, Muhammad, and Guillem Cordoba — applied this rule rigorously to every concept, shaping and reshaping each slide until it was brief yet thorough.",
            "It’s also what led Marcus to make the bold but comforting statement that  in your learning journey you will get it wrong — and that’s okay.  In fact, he encouraged us to get it wrong as often, as quickly, and as publicly as possible, because that’s the fastest way to explore every nook and cranny of our understanding. Once we were even told to “think about all the possible ways that [this concept] could be misunderstood” and share them.",
            "Underneath this, of course, was the understanding that this was a safe place to get things wrong. This was something that the entire team established early on — not just at the beginning of the course but during intake interviews too. And I saw my fellow classmates practicing this, in their respectful listening during lectures and in spontaneous mutual support sessions with each other during free time.",
            "It was only when we all felt comfortable with a concept and had no more questions that we moved on to the next concept. Interjections were encouraged. The facilitators asked us to reflect back what we heard, then worked with us to refine our understanding. We didn’t have to go over every detail, but we did get the chance to grasp the basics well enough to be able to fill in the blanks for ourselves later.",
            "This seems counterintuitive. You might think that this process would slow the whole thing down. But it really works. Instead of taking four days to learn Rust, we finished in only three — which left us more time to learn Holochain! And that’s what everyone was there for anyway.",
            "Many developers are already familiar with other ‘slowing down to speed up’ techniques. Test-driven development, pair programming, agile development, and Git workflow policies sometimes feel like speed bumps in the moment, but they streamline our processes and avoid catastrophic problems later on. I think this was similar; it’s much easier to untangle a small misunderstanding now than a big one later."

It loads Holochain’s  JavaScript client  into the current web page, allowing it to access your local conductor if it has permissions. This led Ryan to start work on another project: a tool to generate a JavaScript API that’s tailored to a specific coordinator zome. It will be able to read the zome’s public functions and call signatures, then create function stubs in JavaScript that call the conductor’s app API and handle serialisation and deserialisation of parameters and return values.",

For a social organism, that could look like community rules or membership-by-invitation. Fortunately Holochain understands that concept at the basic level; your hApp can include a ‘membrane proof’ validation rule that verifies that a person has the right credentials (e.g., that they’ve read and agree to the rules, or that a verified member has invited them).",
            "Currently the Flux app supports three different types of ‘channel’ for your community: messaging, knowledge base (AKA wiki), and long-form (AKA blogging). I’m quite impressed; it already feels like a ‘community in a box’ that supports all sorts of different ways of expressing things. And they appear to have even more channel types planned for the future, along with the ability to support community-created channel types.",

Suddenly, it can create something really special.",

If you got rid of the central database and distributed the data to all the participants, it would certainly help. But now you’ve got a new problem: without any authority to talk to, how do you  find  the data you’re looking for?",
            "The  distributed hash table  (DHT) was created to help solve this problem. A hash table is just a simple index of keys (things you know) that point to values (things you want). It’s a bit like a dictionary: when you want to know the definition of the word  ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ , you take its name (the key) and search through the book until you find it. On the same line you’ll see the definition (the value associated with the key).",

If they don’t have it, it’s likely that they know another nearby machine that does.",

Machines come and go, especially when they’re just users’ laptops and phones, and that means that your ‘best match’ for a data key might disappear for weeks at a time. So we want the participants in a DHT to collaborate to make sure each piece of data is stored by more than one responsible party.",

You take responsibility for storing a copy of all data whose keys fall within it, to the best of your ability. You also know the transport addresses of all peers whose keys fall within it. (A transport address is the address in the underlying networking layer — an IP address, for example. It lets you do the actual communication.) You gossip over the fence regularly, sharing data with each other. If you go offline, your neighbours have your back, because their neighbourhoods overlap with yours and they can ‘heal’ the gap you left behind.",
            "The size of your neighbourhood depends on your capacity and the resilience of your neighbourhood. If you find your device storage is filling up too quickly, rrDHT might choose to shrink your neighbourhood and drop responsibility for some data. And if you notice the coverage just outside your neighbourhood seems a bit weak, rrDHT might enlarge your neighbourhood and help improve resilience there.",

Paulina returns the definition to her.",

If her neighbourhood were just a bit larger, she’d take responsibility for storing a copy herself and gossiping it to her neighbours. She sees that Henry, however, is really close to it. She sends it to him and, because his neighbourhood covers G, he stores it.",

His neighbourhood doesn’t stretch far enough, though, so he doesn’t have it. But within his neighbourhood is Carol, whose neighbourhood does cover it. He sends Carol’s transport address to Maria, who asks Carol for the data.",

And it worked okay for  finding  data — it was fast and well-supported — but the challenge is that we want Holochain to have self-healing storage where data gets moved to peers with nearby addresses. And it was very hard to describe that kind of neighbourhood with Kademlia's nearness algorithm. And Holochain wasn’t just using neighbourhoods for data storage and retrieval – it was using them for security too.",
            "To understand that, we need to back up a bit and look at another problem that pops up when you take the authority out of the middle.",
            "As I mentioned before, if an application wants to work right, it needs an assurance that it’s got a predictable view of the stored data, or state. If you expect X to equal 3 but it actually equals 7, your application might start throwing errors. But when nobody’s in charge of keeping that state consistent, the individual copies can get out of sync and make a mess of things. So you need to figure out who gets to modify that shared memory, and when. That is, how do you prevent two people from modifying the same thing at the same time on their separate machines? (Remember, there’s no central authority anymore — and there’s a new group of bad guys who would love to get involved too.) This problem was identified back in 1983 as the  Byzantine Generals’ Problem .",
            "A common strategy is to select a ‘leader’ — the entity who’s allowed to make writes — and make sure that nobody else can write to the data.",
            "Bitcoin, while  not  the  first  to tackle this problem, is certainly a pioneer when it comes to a strategy for leader selection among an unknown number of untrustworthy members. It simplifies the problem by recording everyone’s data writes in a single journal, of which everyone has a copy. Then a lottery is held every 10 minutes to select the next leader. This lottery helps keep everyone honest. But by design it’s expensive to play, in real time and money. This means that those with more money tend to dominate the game. That doesn’t feel very peer-to-peer anymore.",
            "This is necessary because of Bitcoin’s design choice — that single, shared ledger is pretty attractive to bad actors, so it needs to be well protected. But we don’t think a shared ledger is actually necessary for ensuring data integrity.",
            "Holochain makes things even simpler by saying, “why don’t we just put everyone in charge of their own write journal?” That’s where a peer-to-peer application runs anyway — on the devices of its users. This solves the leader selection problem; everyone is their own leader!",
            "That’s fine when you’re just writing data for yourself. But when you start interacting with others, and everyone's in charge of their own data, how do you police bad data? Particularly problematic is the ability to manipulate your own history; you could do all sorts of fun stuff with that. Make negative balances disappear, change your mind about the politician you just voted for, modify things you said in the past without any accountability trail, etc.",
            "Holochain’s answer is to make everyone accountable to everyone else. And here’s where that neighbourhood model comes in: when a neighbourhood is called on to store a piece of someone else’s public data, they first validate it according to Holochain’s #1 rule (you can’t manipulate your journal) and an application’s particular rules. If they find any suspicious activity, they sound the alarm. This alarm acts like an antibody — it spreads through the network of peers, triggering an immune response in each of them until everyone recognises the bad actor and has taken steps to protect themselves. (This usually looks like putting the bad actor in a block list.)",
            "The address of each piece of data you produce is based on a cryptographic hash. That makes it effectively random, which means you don’t get to choose which neighbourhoods witness and validate your data. This prevents you from colluding with your evil friends and hiding your crime. You can try, but the person you’re trying to deceive has their own view of the DHT. They’re going to talk to the peers  they  trust. And when they find out nobody’s seen the data you said you published, your fraud is exposed.",
            "Not only that, but you cryptographically sign every piece of data you produce. This means that your identity is all over the evidence.",
            "This randomised peer witnessing, validation, and policing is what distinguishes Holochain’s rrDHT from other DHTs — it’s built for data integrity from the ground up. And that’s what makes Holochain able to perform at the speed of DHTs while offering the safety of blockchain."

Software patents feel like they’re part of the old world of enclosure, extraction, and competition.",
            "But in the past few years of working with Holochain and Holo, I’ve come to appreciate the value of building bridges between the current world and the next. But when I reflect on it, I think that’s what we’ve been trying to do all along — working within the structures of the current world in order to birth the new. It’s unsexy, tedious, and sometimes dirty, but maybe it’s where we need to start.",
            "There are a few reasons for this. First, if we don’t understand the rules of the game we’re stuck in, we won’t survive long enough to see the new game to maturity (this is why the troll protection). And reality is hard, messy, and inconsistent — we’re all at various stages of growth, various levels of ability to participate in new games according to our means. The current system isn’t going to just roll over and give us free room and board while we build tools for open collaboration and economics.",
            "We also need to find ways to start unlocking and using the massive power and wealth that the current system is currently holding. We can see them as an asset, rather than a hurdle, and start ‘composting’ them into regenerative systems.",
            "In the case of the CAL, that means we’re using the weapons of today (intellectual property law) to protect this little embryo of an idea we love so dearly. Besides being a standard open-source license, it imposes an extra restriction on those who create software with Holochain:  they’re not allowed to hold your data hostage . It doesn’t mean you get to choose how it’s used (that’s an application-level concern), but it does mean you’ll never be barred from accessing it.",
            "That feels powerful to me. It goes beyond the scope of open-source licenses to ensure freedom beyond just being able to audit and modify code. We’re embedding an ethical stance about data sovereignty into Holochain’s terms-of-use. This puts the CAL into the (sometimes  controversial ) territory of ‘ Ethical Source ’. Personally, I’m okay with that. We’ve always been explicit about our intention to support the commons, and sometimes that means asking people to consent to  restrictions  if they want to play this new game with us. After all, as Dr Elinor Ostrom famously demonstrated,  that's what makes the commons work ."

It’s not an IDE or text editor; it’s simply an ‘overlay’ on your existing Linux or UNIX shell (and that includes WSL2 for Windows) that makes the right versions of all the necessary command-line tools available and ready to use.",
            "You’ve probably used this sort of thing before. It’s often called a ‘reproducible development environment’, and tools like Vagrant, Docker, Virtualbox, and Python’s virtualenv are commonly used to set these up and distribute them among developers who want to share a predictable toolset.",
            "Holonix is built with  Nix,  a package manager that can be installed in your existing OS. Instead of directly changing the state of your system, though, it can create an ‘overlay’ that you can enter and leave as needed. Anything you’ve already got installed, it will ‘shadow’ with its own version. This approach is much lighter than a VM and even somewhat lighter than a Docker container. But just like those other tools, outside of that environment, your familiar shell environment is preserved — just the way you like it.",
            "You can even have a  separate Nix environment for each hApp project you create , by putting a file called  flake.nix  in there with all the dependencies you need. It lets you target and work with different Holochain versions per project. You can think of this file as a  package.json  or  Cargo.toml  file — but for your entire shell and all its commands. You can check this file, along with the  flake.lock  file, into your Git repo to make sure you and other developers always have the right version of the Holochain dev tools when you’re working on the project.",
            "One nice thing about Nix is that it lets your host environment ‘leak’ through into the new dev environment.  Nix merely adds the things specified in your  .nix  file.  So if your  PATH  environment variable points to the locations of all sorts of weird dev tools that you can’t live without, you’ve still got that inside Holonix.",

It might be a piece of digital art, an  algorithmically generated cat , an item of  digital clothing  for your favourite virtual world, or (my favourite, on account of its subtle-yet- undeniable  comment on the nature of crypto-trading) a tulip. That can  fight other tulips .",

            "Or you can put it up in a public place where everyone can enjoy it. Something unexpected is about to happen now: the more people get to see it, the more famous it becomes, which makes it even more valuable. Think about Da Vinci’s  Mona Lisa ; it’s estimated to be worth  $1 billion , and the fact that anybody can print up a copy for their living room hasn’t hurt its value one bit. But the distinction of owning the  original  — now that’s something special, something that people might be willing to drop a billion on.",

At the beginning of the internet age, this suddenly became nearly impossible to enforce.",

What if we decoupled ownership from possession in a way that safely ensured that creators could make a respectable living?

Hashes now come in one extra flavour,  AnyLinkable , and all link manipulation functions now expect a new type called  AnyLinkableHash , which can be converted from an  entry ,  header , or  external  hash (note: the DNA hash is still not linkable, by design). That makes this a  breaking change  for the HDK. All you need to do for existing code, though, is put  .into()  at the end of an entry or agent hash value to convert it into  AnyLinkableHash .",

(See the pattern? Stability!)",

It moves all the features needed for deterministic integrity into two new crates —  holochain_integrity_types  for the types and   holochain_deterministic_integrity  for the host functions ( #1305 ,  #1324 ). (In the process, the HDK no longer depends on rusqlite!)  At this point, you don’t need to do any code edits , as these crates get imported into the HDK for you.

This saves steps, like ‘ensuring’ that the base exists before trying to link to it, which was always subject to eventual consistency glitches that could result in multiple agents trying to create the same entry.  Note:  while this does not by itself break compatibility with your existing code, it does relax the host’s built-in validation behaviour. If you want to get the old behaviour, your link validation code can simply call  `must_get_entry`  on the base and target.",

Occasionally it will change in a way that’s invisible to you as an application developer, but even here your zome code will need to be recompiled in order to work with the updated host API.

All you need is the public key of the person who did the signing (as well as a way of knowing that the public key actually belongs to the person you think it does — which is a whole other story).",

It does exactly what it sounds like it does, adding support for comment threads to your hApp. It comes with a basic but working demo UI so you can play around with it. It doesn’t make assumptions about what sorts of things can have comments attached to them; it just takes an entry hash and a message as input (in fact, that’s what gives you threading for free — you can attach a comment to a comment). This means you can add comment support for anything your app deals in: pictures, blog posts, tweets, transactions, game moves, etc.",

And it’s so nice to see the developer community practicing the same conviviality they aim to foster with the tools they’re building.",

Is there some centralised database keeping track of all the data?”  It really is peer-to-peer, folks  — the only centralisation point (besides the Holo routing infrastructure used to connect testers’ web browsers to their HoloPorts) is the proxy relay, whose only purpose is to connect individual peers to each other through restrictive firewalls.

This is because, under the hood, it used `call_remote`, the feature that lets one agent calls another agent’s zome functions. `call_remote` expects (and waits around for) a return value. This resulted in unnecessary slowdowns, because you don’t need to wait around to learn whether your signal was received — you know everyone else will eventually get the message through the DHT’s slower but more reliable gossip. Not only that, but `call_remote` blocks the zome function and can’t make parallel calls to multiple peers. So the more people are online, the slower everything gets.",

            "A lot of peer-to-peer networks, from decentralised social networks like  Secure Scuttlebutt  to blockchains like Bitcoin, are built on something called ' gossip protocol '. It's a simple protocol, and it works like it sounds like it would work: I know a bunch of people (or rather, computers), and when one of my friends shares something with me I share it with everyone else I know. With this protocol, messages spread rapidly through networks without a central authority.",
            "And it also creates a lot of network traffic. That might be fine for blockchains, in which every machine is online most of the time and needs to know about everything anyway. But for networks that power everyday applications, you want to be respectful of your users' bandwidth -- and you can't expect their machines to be on all the time either. (Even blockchains tweak gossip to make it more efficient.)",
            "Holochain is based on the idea of  'neighbourhoods' of authority  -- each piece of data gets an address, and it's only sent to a group of machines that have taken responsibility for the range of addresses that cover its address. That means traditional gossip is too chatty -- as an authority, you need to constantly make decisions about what to share with your neighbours, given that they aren't responsible for the exact same range that you are.",
            "It gets more complicated when machines are turning on and off all the time (which happens a lot when they're just users' devices). A machine that's been offline for a while will want to get up to date with the latest gossip, and will ask its peers for a digest of new stuff since they were last online.",
            "This means you have to be able to ask your own database questions like \"which of my neighbours' responsibility ranges start before, and end after, address  531993928 ?\" and \"what new data have I collected within my neighbour Alice's responsibility range  112513216  to  241661317  since yesterday morning at 08:37 UTC?\" These sorts of questions, called  range queries , are really hard for a  key/value database  like  LMDB  to answer, but they're really easy for a  relational database  like  SQLite .",
            "Because all data in Holochain is just keys (addresses) and values attached to those keys, LMDB initially made sense -- it was much faster than any relational database out there when it came to key/value lookups, as well as being gentle on CPU and RAM. But as the core developers started looking at  sharding , it became obvious that the large amount of range queries would hurt performance unacceptably if they stuck with LMDB.",
            "As a side bonus, SQLite also makes it possible for us to encrypt source chain and DHT data at rest using  SQLCipher . (Note: this doesn't prevent you from reading your peers' published data -- that's not how Holochain works. But it does prevent an attacker from stealing it if they gain access to your computer.)"

If there are no other show-stopper bugs, it'll replace the current LMDB-based Holochain on all HoloPorts soon.",

The end-user Launcher hosts UIs in a WebView and signs calls with the author key using the built-in Lair keystore, which lets it use the author capability for all calls. That means you don’t need to worry about hApps deployed for use in this context. The Holo-hosted context has also had support for built-in signing and now applies it to zome calls. Finally, the web browser context lets you authorise a browser-generated public key for signing calls.

After my first year of college, I noticed that this was a pattern with other people as well. There’s an inability to move beyond the boundaries that exist within ourselves, which creates division between people and the inability to connect on a deeper level. I went to speak with one of my mentors. We discussed how social media tends to perpetuate the problem in terms of external validation of our self-worth and over-analysis of sharing. We thought that just a shift of awareness in and of itself could cause positive change interactions. An idea evolved for a new kind of social media."

We really respect their intentions and the underlying motivations that influence their approach. They chose a crowdfunding campaign for the Holo infrastructure to demonstrate demand, and to do a more responsible Initial Community Offering (ICO). In terms of the synergy between our teams, the way that we think about things and their integrity has been a powerful driving force in our collaboration. In addition to their technology being superior; it’s also scalable, energy efficient, and does not use global consensus mechanisms that create the bottlenecks that we see with blockchains."

Now everyone had access to a lot more money, which resulted in an explosion of prosperity in the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Maybe the debt was a symbolic one (such as tithes and dowries), or because the parties were too far away from each other (such as international trade). It was especially popular with states and state-backed religions, who used it to pay for projects and wars, then expected it back later as tax and tribute.

            "Let’s return to Alice the farmer and Bob the weaver. You’ll remember that Alice has given Bob some eggs on his promise of a future delivery of firewood. They’ve solved the  coincidence of wants  problem together—they no longer had to wait until they both had something the other wanted.",
            "But let’s say Bob isn’t the wood-chopping type. Now Alice isn’t so sure she wants to give him any eggs. Not that she doesn’t trust him; she just doesn’t think she’ll ever see that firewood.",
            "Enter Bob’s neighbour Charlie. He’s a woodcutter who spends a lot of time outside in the winter. And we already know Bob makes superb blankets. Charlie knows that too, and he’s had his eye on a fetching red one. I think you can see where this is going—Bob can use his social connections to underwrite his promise. Now Alice has more confidence in this deal. Bob still gets his eggs on a promise, Charlie gives Bob some firewood in exchange for a nice new blanket, and Alice gets her firewood. Everyone’s warm and well-fed this winter.",
            "This is great, but it’s a little fiddly. Why does Bob have to be in the middle? He could just promise Alice a blanket, she could trade that promise with Charlie for some firewood, and Charlie could redeem Bob’s promise himself. Goods flow one way, the promise flow the other way, until the obligation is settled.",
            "If you like, you can write these promises down on a piece of paper. That makes it easier for everyone to keep track of them. And you can make them even more versatile by tying their value to some sort of reference unit. Now you don’t need to worry about how many eggs a blanket is worth; you just price each thing against the general unit. Suddenly, those promises are starting to look a lot like… money. Bob dollars, if you will. (And Alice and Charlie dollars too.) Now we’re well on our way to creating a general-purpose currency.",
            "But here’s the odd thing: now that these promises are tradeable, it doesn’t make much sense to say that Bob is obligated to Alice. He’s obligated to the economy at large. We can drop terms like ‘debtor’ and ‘creditor’ which speak of individual relationships. This removes the danger of Bob falling into  debt bondage  to Alice. And it also spreads the cost of  defaulted promises  across the entire economy, rather than forcing Alice to take on all the risk.",
            "And that’s the basis for mutual credit. In a typical implementation, instead of circulating paper promises, each person has their own ledger that records all the promises made and received. It’s really just massively multiplayer double-entry accounting (sexy, right?) When Bob gives a promise to Alice, he records it as a negative number in his ledger and she records it as a positive number in hers. When that promise makes it back to Bob, his negative balance is erased.",
            "Because every promise made is matched by a promise received, the  net  money supply across all participants’ ledgers is always zero. The  circulating  money supply, however, equals all the outstanding promises."

What I do understand is that new money enters circulation when banks issue loans, and it disappears as those loans are repaid. And, just like mutual credit, it happens through a  series of debit and credit records  on various ledgers.",
            "Here’s the big difference, as I see it. With the bank-led credit system, banks have outsized power in the creation and distribution of money. Whereas with mutual credit, the entire economy gets involved. Each transaction is an agreement between two parties to create, honour, or destroy money.",
            "The other difference is that banks lend out their money at interest, and I’ve never seen a mutual credit system that does that. Interest seems to create a vicious cycle of wealth drainage, causing borrowers to borrow more money or extract wealth from elsewhere in order to pay the rent on the money borrowed. It’d be nice to move away from that.",
            "When it’s designed well, mutual credit can help match the money supply to the economy. It  ‘breathes’ , expanding and contracting with the creation and settlement of promises as goods and services are exchanged. When Bob gives Charlie that blanket, the money just disappears—no interest due, no runaway inflation or deflation. Money ceases to be a thing unto itself; it’s just a medium of exchange, a way of measuring the flow of the things that really mean something to us.",
            "And maybe that’s a  good  thing—when we say we want more money, maybe what we really mean is that we’re feeling squeezed and we wish we felt better equipped to take care of ourselves and maybe even indulge in a few nice-to-haves. Money isn’t the point;  deep wealth  is."

You see, Mike was planning an  Ethereum -based crypto venture with his friend Sim Wilson. But Adam had been bugging him for months about a new distributed ledger project called  Holochain . Mike thought he’d at least learn what this thing was about.",

RedGrid was building an ‘internet of energy’ ecosystem with the intent of accelerating the world’s transition to clean electricity, and Mike thought Holochain might be a decent match for their unique needs. Especially attractive was the fact that three of Holochain’s devs lived right there in Melbourne; the prospect of local support was a big plus for him.",

As they began to make connections with the Holochain team and supporters, Mike felt like they were joining a movement rather than adopting a technology.

            "Together RedGrid and Monash were developing a Holochain-based  transactive energy market (TEM)  app to power the campus microgrid. A TEM connects an ecosystem of energy consumers and producers and allows them to tender and fulfill contracts to supply electricity. These markets, such as the  Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) , are poised to become a common feature of national energy grids.",
            "Along with the consensus of the power industry, Monash and RedGrid recognised that the  grid of the future will be decentralised, decarbonised, and digitalised . Decentralisation creates a more robust, adaptive grid, reducing the impact of disruptions and giving local communities more autonomy over their energy provision and distribution decisions. It demands communication and orchestration between individual components in the system, which is why digitalisation is important. But that creates a challenge: with a zillion devices all talking to each other, there is a lot of data being produced, and somebody’s going to have to process it.",
            "That’s why both Monash and RedGrid believed that  digitalisation would have to be decentralised too,  not just energy production and distribution. Their convictions echo the computer industry’s growing sense that, with more devices coming online, intelligence will need to be  pushed from the centre to the edges  in order to keep up with all that data. It was RedGrid’s job to prove that Holochain was the right choice for this job, starting with the TEM component.",
            "The rubber hit the road in July 2020 with an invitation from the Monash Net Zero people: “Let’s see a demo.” Initially the demo called for a benchmark involving five nodes participating in a market. Here’s how it was to work: When an energy-consuming node (say, a campus building) wanted to buy energy, it would open itself to receive bids from a marketplace of energy producers (say, on-campus power generation equipment or national grid companies) for a future time period. These producers would respond by generating bids for slots they wanted to provide power for, writing them to their data stores, and privately communicating them to the consumer. On receiving each bid, the consumer node would record it in their own data store. And periodically (once or twice a second) they would write a ‘market plan’ entry consisting of all the bids they’d received so far. Lastly, the final market plan would get shared with all the bidders.",
            "Because the design was to be used in a distributed network of entities who could be consumers, producers, or even both at any given time, it was expected to be a good test of Holochain’s suitability for such a demanding  edge computing  use case. Each market cycle involved a lot of messages and writes, so it was also a good test of throughput and latency. Both were important metrics for performance; latency doubly so for ensuring that the consumer node awarded contracts fairly.",
            "‘In principle’—there’s that hope again—Holochain’s completely parallel design would allow all this to happen at lightning speed. Then Monash said, “hey, let’s make it 30 nodes instead of five, just to see what it can do.” And then they pressed play.",
            "It must’ve been a discouraging moment for the RedGrid team—their faith in Holochain, their many person-hours of work, their close collaboration with the Holochain ecosystem, culminating in a mere single bid every few minutes. (That’s roughly 0.005 transactions per second for you blockchain folks—although that’s a bit of an inaccurate comparison; read the epilogue to find out why.) One bid even took 17 minutes to go through.",
            "On top of that, Monash noticed that these nodes had to talk through a ‘switchboard’ server called sim2h. That centralisation point was a show-stopper (and probably partly responsible for the low throughput and high latency)."

Mike was pleased to find people from the community rallying around them, working around the clock (literally—they spanned four time zones) to help them migrate the TEM code to RSM.",

A big challenge was the lack of working network transport code, which meant that communication had to happen through node.js-based middleware. But they made it work. By late August RedGrid was once again ready to demo TEM for Monash."

And it’s just in the last month that this has proven out, with Guillem and Connor [and Alfredo, Jesús, and Eduardo] helping us… You can see in GitHub and Discord their discussions with David Meister and Tom Gowan [Holochain core devs], to the point where a community dev actually found things and updated the core. It’s really pretty impressive. And Monash recognised that.”",
            "Dr Adam Bumpus, RedGrid’s CEO, agrees:",
            "“And that was really cool, because you’re building together. For us as a company, we’ve had lots of good support from Art [Brock] and Eric Harris-Braun [Holochain co-founders] from the beginning, and obviously other people Mike mentioned... It makes us feel good—about the community, about the whole mission, and also there are other people out there who are not building on Holochain but believe in what we’re doing, the Holochain/RedGrid combination.”",
            "For us in the Holochain team, this is encouraging news. It means that a thriving ecosystem of developers and supporters is coming to life around us. This feels fitting, because Holochain is modeled after the coordination networks that emerge in living ecosystems. And in emulation of our technology, we’ve tried our best since the beginning to nurture rich human relationships. These relationships, we believe, are more valuable in the long run than flashy marketing campaigns and shallow partnerships.",

If others are walking alongside you, championing your vision and helping you out, you have a better chance of weathering the inevitable storms. It’s all about resilience, and resilience is attractive.",

And we’re seeing this again and again; the people who’ve chosen Holochain support each other. Community-led dev camps, meetups, documentation efforts, contributions to Holochain Core, open-source library collaborations, chat conversations, and plenty of healthy feedback and critique on Holochain itself are making the ecosystem much stronger than our small team ever could by itself. Just like RedGrid, we feel like it’s making Holochain resilient and well-equipped to take on the challenges of bringing a new way of building software into the world."

            "I think the big story here is how encouraging it is to see an ecosystem of creators and builders supporting each other to help bring one player’s vision to life. But the numbers are interesting in their own right, to show just how much Holochain RSM has improved over the previous version.",
            "So first I’d like to give some more details about the test as I understand it from talking to Mike, Connor, and Guillem. (Sorry to the three of you if I get some details wrong!) As I go along I’ll try to interpret the results for you.",
            "Each market period spans nominally 24 hours, and bidders can bid on as many five-minute intervals in that period as they like. Each bid consists of about 1 kb of data. Because the consumer node has to record each bid it receives, the activity in the bidding window’s time period is a good test of throughput, or write ops per second. (In the blockchain world this would get called transactions per second, or TPS, although this isn’t a terribly meaningful metric to apply to Holochain—more on that later.) None of the entries are public, so they don’t have to be published to the DHT, but they are written to their authors’ personal journals and broadcast to the appropriate parties. This is where latency matters. And finally, the market plans get quite large—by the end of the test, the final market plan is about 100 kb. This tests Holochain’s ability to write large blobs without choking.",
            "Monash didn’t want to artificially cripple this test in any way; they wanted RedGrid to hold Holochain’s feet to the fire in order to get a sense of how it might perform in the real world. (Mike tells me that a marketplace network might consist of tens of thousands of nodes, each of whom can be both producer and consumer simultaneously.)",
            "In the real world , these  nodes would be autonomous computers  running in appliances, energy generation/storage hardware, buildings, or energy companies’ offices; for the purpose of the demo it was enough to use multiple  Docker  containers on one physical machine (and besides, RedGrid weren’t able to directly access the devices in Monash’s lab during  one of the world’s longest-running COVID-19 lockdowns ). That means that wire latency wasn’t being tested, just latency of the system itself. Additionally, because the team had to use node.js middleware in place of the not-yet-implemented Holochain P2P network transport, the speed of the middleware contributed to the latency figures. (Mike suspects that it added latency.)",
            "Here’s a graph of how the consumer node fared in the RSM demo. It doesn’t capture initial spin-up of the application (which causes a momentary CPU spike to 100%); it just captures the consumer node’s ability to keep up with all the bids it’s receiving.",
            "Each bidder is throttled to send only three bids per second. 29 bidders × 3 bids/sec = 87 write ops per second; the consumer node is able to handle everything the bidders can throw at it.",
            "The initial spike in activity is accompanied by a modest CPU spike of only 40%. A big reason for this improvement over the previous version of Holochain is that the core team has put a lot of work into improving  concurrency , removing bottlenecks in places where threads were waiting for other threads to finish. (When testing HoloFuel on the previous version of Holochain, we found that this problem compounded when you introduced multiple nodes.)",
            "RAM also stays nice and low. Optimal use of the database engine ( LMDB ) is responsible for most of this, and the core team is constantly watching how they use and tune LMDB to keep a good balance between memory consumption and disk swapping latency.",
            "We see ops/sec tapering off as the test continues, yet CPU and RAM don’t appear to be bottlenecks. The RedGrid dev team suspects that this may be due to unsynchronised bidding times—that is, bidders start at roughly the same time but some finish early.",
            "I’m eager to follow RedGrid’s future testing efforts. I asked them why they throttled bidder nodes. They explained that, when bid frequency increased, the consumer node hit a bug that caused it to go to 100% CPU and hang. A fix is already in the works and will be committed soon; It’ll be interesting to see what test results will look like at that point (my prediction is that we’ll see another >5× improvement). Guillem also shared with me that architectural changes to their TEM app, such as relying more on the DHT, might improve throughput by an order of magnitude as well."

But it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison; it’s more like apples-to-lobsters. Every time I think I’ve captured the essence of each platform such that I can compare it to Holochain, another dimension pops up and I have to rethink everything.",
            "For instance, that old favourite metric of blockchain enthusiasts, transactions per second, doesn’t really apply to Holochain. Because each participant carries their own weight in parallel with other nodes, there is no max TPS for the network; the equivalent metric would be max write ops per participant per second.",

            "There is one thing that sim1h and sim2h have in common: both rely on a central point connecting the agents -- but that is about it.",
            "While sim1h is very similar to contemporary centralized front-end / back-end architecture in that it uses a database as the central component,  sim2h does not rely on any centralized data persistence!  Instead it plays a role similar to these old telephone switch-boards where an operator takes a request of a network participant and sets up the appropriate connection to another participant (without storing or controlling what those participants say on that line).",
            "Interestingly, this actually reduces complexity compared to the sim1h solution where the network had to be simulated inside a database which meant actually storing messages and then polling for messages on the other end. The concept of a switch-board, which maintains active websocket connections to each agent that is online, works much better with all the assumptions that have been made in other parts of the Holochain stack -- mainly Holochain core, as well as lib3h. In fact, that central component of sim2h borrows a lot from already existing pieces and in essence is like the in-memory network that we’ve used in core for local testing of multiple instances (i.e. mocking the network in-memory). In other words, Sim2h uses the websocket implementation from lib3h to create encrypted “wormholes” between each Holochain conductor instance and this central “in-memory” switch-board.",

            "Note that the above bullet points are  not  true for sim1h, as messages (as well as entry data) is stored in the centralized database and that’s what nodes rely on. Getting rid of that database both gets us much closer to the network structure that Holochain is built for and also has avery important pragmatic benefit:  the central component doesn’t need to be protected the way a database would need to as it doesn’t manage any persistent state .",
            "The database sim1h uses can’t just be made available publicly on the internet -- even for testing purposes -- without asking for trouble. Sim2h on the other side just facilitates connections between nodes of the same DNA. The state of the DHT is stored exclusively in all the nodes at the edges. Any change has to pass through the DNAs validation rules the same way it would in a fully peer-to-peer setting.",
            "This difference is precisely what enables us to use sim2h right now for our first public Holochain test network. This is also an important prerequisite for Holo’s first test network.",
            "That said, the fact that all messages are routed through a single point creates a single point of failure, which surely is not what you would want for a production ready p2p framework. But it actually is very beneficial for test networks, as already described  in the post about sim1h . That’s because, in all alpha test networks, and potentially in early betas, we definitely want to be able to log network messages as needed in order to gain a global view for debugging. So we believe the single point of failure is a reasonable trade-off (during alpha and early beta phases) for the ability to analyse the network. And should that central point actually experience issues, we can spawn new machines without even managing any application data, since that is stored at the node level."

What this means is that currently sim2h orchestrates the network to have a full copy of all the entry data at each node - i.e. a full-sync or  mirror  DHT.",

            "The next step that is  already being worked on , is to pull in more lib3h code and implement rrDHT style sharding with sim2h. This is a good example of the benefit that this approach gives us: we can test out high-level assumptions and algorithms just by changing the gossip logic within the sim2h server, which has all the needed information within its local transient memory. It is much easier to iterate on different aspects of the networking implementation and get each aspect (like the sharding algorithms) right, before jumping to a fully decentralized network which is just much harder to analyse.",
            "I want to close by expressing my personal excitement about the fact that with sim2h we don’t have to wait any longer until all aspects of lib3h are proven out and ready to be used as a whole. Instead, we can shift into a much more agile pattern and work more closely together with the community of hApp developers, since now (after more than a year of waiting for the “Rust refactor”) we have a fully working Holochain stack again.",

Over the last 3 weeks (David Meister created  the first commit  during our dev retreat in Montreal) we have built a near-term, centralised networking component for testing called  sim1h . It is a simulation of lib3h, our p2p network and DHT implementation that has been—and continues to be—the main focus of the Holochain networking team.",
            "When I first heard Jamison (our Director of Product) suggest implementing sim1h alongside lib3h, of course I thought: “WTF?! A centralised back-end for Holochain? ”. I also felt myself rejecting this idea because I thought we needed all hands on deck to iron out lib3h. But then two insights in particular made me shift to the other end of the spectrum and feel super excited about this idea:",

                "Debugging and analyzing test networks : Imagine lib3h were all ready to go and we enter the Open Alpha Testnet with a fully decentralised network stack. Even if the whole Holochain stack worked without any bugs and quirks (though we do expect some bugs—that’s why it’s called alpha), there would still be lots of hApps (both our internal as well as external hApps) that will need debugging. Exactly for this reason we were planning to have Holochain nodes and HoloPorts send logs and other state information to a single node for diagnostics anyway. Sim1h just takes this idea to another level, and reduces work, since it is running as a simulated network that lets us see all the information that nodes are exchanging without having to implement special debugging and analytics code. Usually, distributed applications don’t let anyone see all information being exchanged on the network, but this is crucial for accurate and quick debugging.",
                "Iterative, parallel staging : During these last few months we’ve become more aware of the hidden complexities involved with trying to integrate two horizontal pieces of a vertical technology stack. Holochain core, with it’s overlay network of AgentIDs, is working fine within the boundaries of its tests and in-memory network. Lib3h is working fine within the test suites that try to mock a real-world usage. However, putting two built-out and complicated pieces together after developing each in isolation led to all sorts of complex behaviors that take quite some effort to analyse, test out, and debug. Eric described some of this in a  recent AMA . Having a much less complex replacement network implementation that simply works as expected gives us a fully working Holochain stack such that hApp developers can start testing and using their hApps. I am personally even more excited about the evolutionary path this enables because we can now take and replace pieces of the whole system in small iterations. For example with sim1h we can  tackle Holochain’s direct messages in a peer-to-peer manner, while the DHT gossip and queries still run through the simulated network. And then as a next step we’ll be able to easily pull in lib3h’s DHT code into a single simulation and prove that the high-level logic and our new DHT algorithms work fine (without implementing a full peer-to-peer DHT - and testing that simultaneously). And we can do all of that, before adding the complexity involved with low-level connection handling, NAT traversal, peer discovery, etc. This provides huge improvements for us in terms of time-to-delivery and testing capabilities."

While part of this reset involves aligning expenses with budget, it goes deeper than that. We’re aligning the entire organization around a recommitment to agile practices, and delivering real, immediate needs to our dev community and customers at all times. In the last weeks we’ve begun synchronizing our planning cycles across development, communications, marketing, customer support, and developer support. At the beginning of each cycle, our intention is to listen deeply to both internal and external voices as we ask each other: “what’s the next most important thing we can work on?” Though we’ve always been in a continual process of learning and improving how we work together, we believe this latest iteration will markedly upgrade the full product loop from inside our team, out to you, and then back again to our team. We aren’t finished with these latest changes to the ways we work, but the development teams are already enjoying big improvements as they unify their to-do lists, dev cycles, and planning meetings.",

You’ll be pleased to know that your voice will be present at the table, right beside our internal teams, HoloPort owners, and HOT hodl-ers. We’ve created a new team, Service Operations, whose job is to deeply listen and champion the needs of every one of you. We’re not just improving integration between teams; we’re setting an intention to become more responsive to the whole community. Ultimately we want to remove blockers to your success, because when you win, everybody wins.",

And because we’re humans, making software, that is running on hardware in a world with real financial constraints, it is by nature a complex decision matrix. So depending on  your  perspective and needs it might sometimes feel like we’re giving more attention to this chunk of software or that piece of the network. But the reality is we need to deliver on all of our promises to a diverse group of stakeholders for us to succeed in our long-term vision. Through that process we want to share that we’re committed to supporting the needs of every stakeholder, not just a few. The highlights below hint a little about what this means. We’ll continue to share more as we work on things like a responsive, iterative roadmap and regular calls for input from devs, community leaders, and hosts in the ecosystem."

And you can look forward to  pagination  and  sorting  of links queries in a future release, along with a  new WebAssembly engine  that massively improves DNA performance and shrinks DNA package size. This new engine also fixes several critical memory bugs (e.g. now you can allocate up to 4gb of memory for arguments to wasm functions whereas the old limit was closer to 640kb) and it is generally simpler to understand."

This major milestone was  announced with little fanfare , which belies how momentous of an occasion this is. Holochain-RSM has not just matched the previous Holochain-Redux for features; it’s gone past it. As many of you following this project know already, Redux  used a centralised ‘switchboard’ server  for testing, and for a large part of our HoloFuel testing cycle, struggled with  DHT consistency issues .",

Nevertheless, prior to last week application instances hosted in one conductor could talk to each other, which gave us confidence that these consistency bugs were a thing of the past. Now, with the networking module integrated, Holochain RSM has proven that it can work fully P2P* over the actual real internet too. And it’s fast.",

Additionally, we’re using a  ‘bootstrap’ service  to help make initial introductions between peers, but this is not a required component either.)",

          "header": "Code A: Giving the ecosystem a stake in the economy",
          "content": [
            "Dr Leanne Ussher is an economist who works with Code A, which is short for ‘Community Decision-making for Ecosystem Adaptation/Accountability/Action’. It’s a project created by an international group of professors, and it aims to build tools that help communities understand and be more intentional about their impact on the planet. And because the economy’s tendrils are woven through every aspect of our society and environment, part of this work means developing a much more accurate way of seeing our economy within its geography.",
            "Traditional economic models assume an ideal person —  Homo economicus  — who makes rational decisions about what’s best for them. And what’s true of an individual, they reason, is true of the sum of these individuals, or the economy: given a whole marketplace of these mythical self-interested, intelligent decision-makers, things will settle into the most beneficial situation for everyone. Philosopher Adam Smith called this the ‘ invisible hand ’ of the market, and many economists since have grounded their economic theories on a faith in this principle. And things do seem to work this way — for simple, competitive markets that we make easy to understand.",
            "But that’s not true of most real markets. Dr Ussher’s complaint of traditional macroeconomic theory is that it assumes individual independence. This simplification supports aggregation and generalisation but it can’t anticipate the complex and surprising things that happen when a bunch of individuals get together and interact. At best, it vaguely asserts that scale does not matter and a description for an individual is also a description for a market. But in reality, we see this theory break down in catastrophic ways in an unequal world; it seems that the invisible hand has always had tremors.",
            "My hunch is that the economy has become too large, complex, and dominated by big players for anyone to make truly rational decisions in their own self-interest. How do I make sense of whether my smartphone purchase is going to come back to haunt me and my grandchildren? It’s merely one among  1.5 billion each year ; does it really contribute that much to civil unrest in Africa, pollution in China, and increased CO₂ levels all around the world? But then again, I recognise that “no individual raindrop considers itself responsible for the flood”. In our acceptance of the sole moral guide of economics —  does it benefit me  — it seems we paradoxically end up doing things that are very, very bad for ourselves. And even if we’d like to  excuse  ourselves, we’re often unsure how — life in the global north all but demands that I own one of these stupid smartphones.",
            "Post-Keynesian macroeconomics , a branch of economics that gains insight through accounting equations of an economy as a whole, attempts to correct for the flaws in microeconomic theories of independent individuals by recognising that complex systems are always greater than the sum of their parts. It creates models founded on theories of the entire economic system, populates those models with big aggregate data, and uses the output to inform policies of regional and national governments and international trade.",
            "This is the school of thought that Dr Ussher comes from. But she also acknowledges that there are blind spots in such a theory too: its abstract models and aggregated data sets take a big-picture view, and it doesn’t offer an explanation or prescription for individual behaviour. As such, it doesn’t tell us how we can organise our individual decisions for better global outcomes.",
            "Dr Ussher explains that micro- and macroeconomics both have their place, but they’re taught as separate classes in university and there isn’t really any good way to reconcile the two. It would be great, she says, if there were something that could combine the micro’s individual behaviour approach with the macro’s systems thinking lens. A sort of ‘grand unified model’ for economics.",
            "Then she says something that surprises me: Valueflows, the economic grammar at the heart of hREA, offers a path in this direction. It records the flow of resources between individuals, but it records them from an  independent  view — as a transaction between parties rather than a set of entries in two disconnected ledgers. She claims that this bookkeeping ‘in the open’ is the thing that could align macroeconomic models more closely with the reality of interdependent individuals. And while she acknowledges that this could have serious consequences for privacy and autonomy if done wrong, she’s also thrilled about the immense potential if done right.",
            "At this point, my mind begins to drift back home — could this be useful at the micro level too? If global markets are inefficient because we lack information and power, could Valueflows make more local flows visible, helping us make better decisions in the places where our choices matter? If we could all see unmet needs and unused resources around us, perhaps new businesses would emerge to close those gaps. This would in turn bring the feedback loops between our actions and their consequences closer to home, giving us even more information for wise decision-making.",
            "Dr Ussher’s vision goes beyond mere commerce. With Valueflows, individuals, households, corporates, and governments are not the only agents that make choices and are held accountable; trees, rivers, animals, even the atmosphere could be represented as agents, with rights, duties and decisions via carefully designed smart contracts. As we build an accounting ecosystem of agents, resources and processes with a rich body of shared data, we will be able to see more clearly how our individual — and collective — decisions impact our planet and each other.",
            "With this vision, she  hints  at a much broader concept of the popular term ‘metaverse’. Rather than mere escapism underwritten by advertising money, Valueflows could equip it to become a tool for creating ‘digital twins’ of agents (human and non-human) and resources (artificial and natural, concrete and abstract) and giving them legitimacy in our economics systems.",
            "Given that legal and financial systems are already digital, mapping and controlling our behaviour, she asks whether it’s really such a jump to empower a tree with its own digital presence in an economic metaverse — and endow it with its own agency. This is what excites her most about Valueflows, because it carries the promise of including all entities that we regard as important, holding all participants accountable, and designing features to rebalance inequities in market power, rights, and duties. By giving the biosphere rights, we can internalise externalities. This is nearer than you might think — legal systems are already recognising  bees  and  rivers  in this way.",
            "Recently Dr Ussher was supporting a cohort of students at Simon’s Rock Bard College with exercises involving coordination of student tasks in the campus garden and collecting kitchen waste for composting, or designing a new accounting protocol to reduce Australian deforestation and biodiversity loss.",
            "In these exercises, the goal was to use a Holochain app called  REA Playspace , a canvas that allows them to create models of an economic network. Spread out like this, poorly managed resources (things we might call ‘externalities’) and unserved needs are plainly visible. This can spark spontaneous insights into ways to improve the  circularity  of resource flows, design feedback loops that promote biodiversity, even create business opportunities along the way.",
            "Dr Ussher still plans to use hREA in real on-campus pilot projects. As they progress, she hopes that their reach will quietly, slowly expand to include more local economic activity. Like leaven in the dough, the idea of  deep wealth  could eventually permeate and transform the way we do accounting, and how we hold each other accountable."

          "header": "NY Textile Lab: Putting designers at the front of the supply network",
          "content": [
            "Laura Sansone is a textile designer and Adjunct Professor of Sustainable Textile Design at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, NY. When she moved to the Hudson Valley, about an hour north of New York City, she became good friends with the orchardist who leased her new property. She saw him selling his produce at a farmer’s market in NYC one weekend, so they got to talking about local food systems. She started to wonder —  why do we care so much about local food systems but barely talk about local textiles?  After all, the local food movement was all about understanding and improving the impact of the way we eat, so why don’t we have a similar relationship with what we wear? Her intimacy with the textile and fashion industry, which  harms us  and our  planet , told her that it could stand to learn a lot from the local food movement.",
            "Sansone came to realise that relocalising clothing production is a good deal more challenging; there are a lot more people between a sheep and your sweater than there are between a tomato plant and tonight’s dinner. As a textile designer, she found herself at the very end of a network of producers, processors, and distributors who had already made their own decisions about what materials she could work with.",
            "So she put herself at the front of the supply chain.  As a designer, she reasoned, she would have the power to make impactful choices if she could be involved in the whole process. Starting small, she aggregated wool from several small local farmers, transported it in a borrowed pickup truck, and brought it to the few remaining wool processing facilities in the New York bioregion — one of which was just a farmer with a handful of washing machines in her garage to wash the animal fibers.",
            "This wasn’t meant to turn into a business; it was just supposed to prove that Sansone’s idea for a local textile economy could work. However, she soon found herself selling her yarn to other designers, and eventually creating a line of  finished products  for sale.",
            "Now, at the centre of  NY Textile Lab , a small but growing collaborative network of producers, processors, and designers, she and her partner Evan Schwartz need something more than an address book and a pile of spreadsheets.",
            "Sansone and Schwartz were attracted to hREA because it’s expressive enough to model the complexity of the rich web of relationships they’re weaving. They intend to record details about the raw materials and the processes they went through, such as transport miles and climate-beneficial verifications, so customers can see exactly what went into their garments. They also want individual designers to be able to merge their buying power, simplifying procurement and reducing costs for everyone.",
            "With this complexity comes a lot of administration, so they’re looking forward to using hREA to automate most of that. As a generic toolkit that uses a simple ontology for building all sorts of economic applications, it can be used for bookkeeping, inventory, supply chain management, certification tracking, enterprise resource planning, alternative currencies, and even sharing of production process recipes.",
            "Listening to Schwartz explain their vision, I wonder what the value proposition is for designers. It sounds like they might struggle to understand why they would want to be more transparent, choosing to give up the competitive edge that  supply chain trade secrets  give them. He answers my concerns before I even voice them: This isn’t meant for the Ralph Laurens and Patagonias out there. They already have their supply chains in place, and they’re already working to answer customers’ demand for more visibly ethical sourcing.",
            "This is meant for small designers and light industry, in order to grow a more horizontal economic model — the recent design school grad who’s starting her brand with a production run of only 20 sweaters, the small farmer only raising a few dozen animals, the ‘mini mill’ that is currently serving ‘handcrafters’. These people currently don’t have the power to compete in the same way; the landscape of potential suppliers is challenging to navigate, and as individuals they don’t have the ability to meet minimum order quantities, nor the purchasing power to make their production economical. The patterns Sansone and Schwartz are building are giving these smaller designers the ability to enter the market — as well as giving sustainable livelihoods to local farmers and regional processors.",
            "Listening more deeply, I realise that they’re actually building an open-source economic model for the textile industry — and local markets in general. In the logic of this economy, everyone succeeds when supply chain relationships and other intellectual property are shared. And Sansone and Schwartz plan to share their templates as they evolve, enabling other local production economies to spring up across the world.",
            "And more than that — they’re building an economy that functions ecologically. Ecosystems don’t usually create chains, because chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Instead, ecosystems create  webs  — complex patterns of relationship with multiple interdependencies and redundancies. Schwartz claims that this is the way to build supply systems that are resilient in the face of disruptions. And  goodness knows  we could use a bit more of that."

          "content": [
            "NY Textile Lab isn’t the only one building an economy that understands the ecosystem it belongs to. For the last eleven years  Sensorica , producers of electronic hardware, has been operating as what’s known as an  open value network , or OVN. Rather than a hierarchically organised company, an OVN is a decentralised network of economic agents, each of them free to do their own thing but linked to each other by collaborative relationships.",
            "Tiberius Brastaviceanu, the co-founder of Sensorica, tells me that they borrow ideas from self-organising systems such as insect colonies. Most importantly, their network operates on a few simple rules that produce complex — and ultimately meaningful — behaviour.",
            "The first rule is this: you can do whatever you like, but whatever you do,  make it  visible .  Announce it and document it. If you’ve got a 3D printer, make it available. If you’ve come up with a design for a more efficient  heat recovery ventilator , share the source files along with your research process. That lets others build on your offerings and increase the total value in the system.",
            "Biologists who study insect colonies came up with a word for this:  stigmergy , or ‘leaving signals in your environment for others to act on’. This appears to be the chief principle that makes self-organising systems work. Although it may seem chaotic, the end result is not. I mean, just look at what these bees created without a boss. (It’s actually a  myth  that the queen is in charge.)",
            "Brastaviceanu echoes Dr Ussher’s concerns about the privacy and autonomy issues that crop up when we aggregate so much of our data like this. But he believes that Holochain resists this risk by embedding an ethos of ‘data commons’ — a democratisation of knowledge, through a  peer-to-peer database , that prevents big players from  capturing  that knowledge and controlling access to it.",
            "There are other rules that draw inspiration from nature, such as the  right to raise a red flag  if you see someone doing or proposing something that could harm the network.",
            "But one rule comes directly from traditional economics. All relationships are underwritten by something called a  benefit redistribution algorithm , an agreement that defines how benefits will be distributed in a venture. For example, when your product is exchanged for money, the proceeds get distributed, not just to you but also to the equipment operators, designers, and parts suppliers in the OVN that sit upstream of the product. Before that point, all those contributors are shareholders; after that point, they all get their dividends. You can think of it like a  stock , but for an individual sale rather than an entire company.",
            "You’d be justified in thinking that this sounds like a lot of data to keep track of. That’s why Sensorica is a key supporter of hREA, which was explicitly designed to keep track of complex agreements and resource flows involving multiple forms of resources.",
            "In fact, Brastaviceanu explains that the design of Valueflows is based directly on learnings from the first version of their software, called Network Resource Planning or NRP. Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen of Mikorizal Software  created  it from scratch, because traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting software focuses on a single company, not a network of actors. Now Foster and Haugen are stewarding the creation of an ecosystem of Valueflows-based tools, many (though  not all ) of which are built on hREA.",
            "Because it uses Holochain, hREA is doing to NRP’s software architecture what NRP did to ERP’s economic assumptions: it breaks down barriers and connects actors together. There is no server in a Holochain app; each user simply connects to other users’ machines to share data and make transactions. And when two networks want to start interacting with each other — as in the case of Sensorica collaborating with a copywriting community in Brazil — the barrier is low, because each participant has full access to the data in the spaces they belong to. This lays the foundation for highly interoperable applications.",
            "Brastaviceanu tells me that one of the things about Holochain that excites him the most is the capacity for groups to create their own applications by connecting smaller components into a greater whole. This is exemplified by a  groupware application ‘container’  called  We , which already has a few simple  components  and expects to add many more (including ones for hREA and  reputation intelligence ) in the future.",
            "Brastaviceanu believes that cooperative producer networks will only succeed in the global marketplace if they have the tools to capitalise on and grow their ‘collaborative advantage’. He sees open-source software like hREA and  We  as critical tools to help make that dream become reality."

            "Reflecting on these three stories, the overarching theme I see is that our narrow focus on self-interest has blinded us to the massive possibilities available to us when we start cooperating — not accidentally as puppets of Smith's invisible hand, but with intention. The fact is, we all end up better when we choose to work together. I know that sounds like something you learned in kindergarten. But it seems we unlearn this as we grow up, and it's time to relearn it.",
            "These three projects, along with a handful of others in places like Sweden and Colombia, are courageously building economic experiments based on what they learned in kindergarten, and it’s working. And hREA, having reached its first  major milestone release , is getting prepared to power the economic intelligence behind all of these projects. It's working and ready for developers to hack on, as seen in this  demo video.",
            "Some of these projects are already sturdy saplings while others are still seeds. But I see in them all a promise of something different for our world — economies that unify local production with global concerns, that apply the cooperative logic and transparency of open-source to business, that re-internalise precious externalities, and that honour diverse forms of capital.",

This improves the security of web hApps — in fact, this change was made in anticipation of the upcoming breaking change to Holochain, in which  capabilities  will finally be enforced on all zome function calls. This will reduce vulnerability to attacks from locally installed malware. With calls coming from embedded WebViews, the Launcher knows that it’s an ‘official’ UI making the call and applies the author capability (that is, the owner of the source chain), which gives strong protection with no hassle for devs.",
            "We’re aware that some applications want ‘headless’ hApps without a bundled UI, either ones that are accessed from another hApp’s cells or UIs, or have an external client (e.g., a hybrid Web2/Holochain UI or a background service that polls an IoT sensor). As you can see above, there’s a section in the Launcher’s installed apps screen for those, and the Launcher still exposes their functions via a local WebSocket port which will soon require capability tokens as described in the previous paragraph."

I didn’t find what I was looking for, but I did find a strange and compelling project called Holochain. As I learned more about it, I realised that it did speak to my desire for such software (and more). Now I see the very thing I was imagining come to life as a collection of modules for building apps, and I’m absolutely thrilled.",

We’ve published an  interview with Connor , a set of  case studies  on three groups that plan to use hREA, and an  Ecosystem Sessions video . Watch the  hREA blog category , Holochain’s  Twitter account , and our  YouTube channel  for more as they come out.",

You’ll note that I’m now listing the  previously announced  HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate as a separate thing — this library has only existed as part of the HDK before this release, but it becomes a separate thing from now on.",
            "I have to admit that the title of this Dev Pulse is not exactly true. As you may know, data integrity is critical when groups of people want to coordinate their actions. If you can’t trust what your peers are saying and doing, you can’t move forward safely with them.",
            "Also, when I say ‘coordination’ I’m not even talking about that kind of coordination. I’m talking about something more low-level and programmer-ish: one application instance coordinating the flow of its own processing and data, nothing more.",
            "And finally, they’re not really parting ways — it’s just that the pieces of your hApp’s code that are responsible for data integrity  will be split  from the pieces that are responsible for application execution. They’ll exist in separate zomes in your DNA. If you’re familiar with the MVC (model, view, controller) programming pattern, you could look at it this way:",
            "Your application’s  integrity zomes  comprise its  model layer  — everything that defines the shape of the data. In practice, this means three things: entry type definitions, link type definitions, and a validation callback that constrains the kinds of data that can validly be called entries and links of those types.",
            "And the  coordination zomes  comprise its  controller layer  — the code that actually commits data, retrieves it, handles countersigning sessions, and sends and receives messages between peers or between a cell and its UI. In other words, all your zome functions, your `init` functions, your remote signal receivers, and your scheduler callbacks will all live in coordination zomes.",
            "To repeat what I described a few months ago, the intention is to  let you split  the core integrity components of your application, which define the unalterable rules of the game, from the business logic. That way, your DHT can last a long time yet still receive upgrades and bug fixes — as long as you don’t need to change your integrity components.",
            "And we’re making the same promise for the reduced library that your integrity components are built on — the HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate. Once it reaches its 0.1.0 release, we plan to keep HDI stable for a while between minor releases.",
            "You’re probably wondering how to refactor your hApp given this substantial change. Here are the most important things to know:",
            "Your DNA manifest file is broken into  integrity  and  coordinator  sections.   integrity  holds everything that affects the DNA’s hash: the list of integrity zomes, the DNA properties, the UID, and a new  origin_time  field that indicates the earliest possible timestamp for a source chain entry, which is used to prevent time-travel attacks.  Only the  integrity  section affects your DNA hash.",
            "coordinator  holds the list of coordination zomes. Coordination zomes must explicitly list their dependencies; that is, the integrity zomes that contain definitions for the entry and link types they intend to write. (If you have only one integrity zome, however, you don’t need to list it as a dependency in any of the coordination zomes.) Here’s a complex example with multiple zomes of both kinds:",
            "As mentioned, your  entry/link definitions, membrane proof self-checks, and validation callbacks will need to be moved into integrity zomes  with only one core dependency on the HDI crate  holochain_deterministic_integrity . This crate has been around for a while, but you haven’t needed to worry about it until now because it was just part of the HDK. (It still is, but it now is meant to exist independently of the HDK.) integrity zomes should not depend on the full HDK — it’s not going to remain stable over time like HDI is. There are new macro helpers for defining entry and link types. The test suite has examples of an integrity zome with  entry types  and  link types .",
            "All of your  zome functions, init callbacks, remote signal receivers, and scheduler callbacks should go into coordination zomes . They can (and likely should) depend on the full HDK, which still includes  holochain_deterministic_integrity  as a dependency.",
            "Only the coordination zomes can use non-deterministic host functions in the full HDK such as source chain commits and queries, DHT gets, agent activity queries, signal emitters, remote calls, and complex crypto functions. Integrity zomes can only use deterministic functions such as  must_get_* ,  dna_info ,  zome_info , and simple crypto functions such as hashing. This makes sense, because the only functions available to your validation callback are the deterministic ones; this just becomes explicit with the separation between HDI and the rest of the HDK.",
            "There are some changes that remove  zome_id  from the headers of entry and link creation elements. These changes are temporary and will be  reverted  in a future release . In fact, before the 0.1.0 release of HDI there will likely be  more changes , although they will mostly be hidden behind macros and other conveniences. If you want to have a say in the usability of the hApp development experience, please jump in now and tell us what you think. But if you desire stability, it’s probably best to wait until 0.1.0.",

You can specify how many of them  must  sign  in order for the session to complete; that number must be equal to or greater than a majority of the optional signers. This is useful for reaching ‘micro-consensus’ over rivalrous data such as usernames, in a way that tolerates downtime among trusted authorities.  Note:  When using optional witnesses, the session  must  use an enzyme, who must be the first agent in both the list of signing agents and the list of optional signers. This allows the process to be more efficient and less ambiguous than waiting for the DHT to reach consistency. ( #1394 )"

            "This Holochain release was a quiet rollout of a change we’ve been working on and getting excited about for a while: a new syncing strategy for rrDHT called Quantised Gossip. It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a  patent application  for it.",
            "If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.",
            "Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.",
            "But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.",
            "So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the  intro to rrDHT , the  Core Concepts article on the DHT , and this  small Dev Pulse section  about a recent change to arcs.",
            "Previously, we were using something called a  Bloom filter . It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.",
            "The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.",
            "Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.",
            "Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.",
            "[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.]  rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.",
            "There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.",

At that point it wasn’t yet operational — the required data structures were simply ready for future functionality — but now the networking layer fully supports it. ( #1472 )",
            "So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.",
            "But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘ forked ’ their chain.",
            "Enzymatic countersigning partially solves this problem. In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.",
            "Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing. Some signers can be offline and the session will still complete — as long as the enzyme is online. That’s because an enzyme is a necessary participant when optional signers are involved; they’re the one who determines exactly  which  optional signers get recorded as counterparties, so that everyone can validate the transaction in a consistent manner.",

When your node publishes an entry to the DHT, validators expect you to provide a “validation package.” This package can contain the public entries from your source chain, the headers, both, or neither, according to how that entry type is validated. Previously, your node would have had to supply the package to every validator at validation time, meaning they could only do their work if you were online. This is fine if you’ve just published an entry, because you’re likely to subsequently remain online for at least a little while. However, if a few hours have passed and one of the validators has disappeared, the newly elected validator can’t do anything until you return.",

            "As we’ve mentioned, Holo was designed to be a bridge between the traditional World Wide Web and a new decentralized internet. While HoloPorts store and propagate entries in the decentralized fashion consistent with Holochain, users can instruct a hosted hApp using an ordinary web browser. All users need to do is log in with a username and password, just as you would on any other website. The connection is end-to-end encrypted (TLS terminates at the HoloPort, not the Holo gateway).",
            "Other static assets, including UIs, can be served from anywhere. Crucially, there is NO requirement for hardware wallets, key store files, or other things typically associated with accessing decentralized networks such as Bitcoin. While this makes the process of accessing a hApp really user friendly, the setup does have potential weaknesses:",

                "Traffic for hosted hApps has to be routed through Holo’s distributed gateway infrastructure. While this infrastructure may contain security gaps that could be exploited by bad actors, we have made it as secure as possible (e.g., SNI, E2E encryption, etc.)."
              ]
            },
            "Our approach to handling these issues has been to develop a secure  iFrame  we’re calling  Chaperone . The application generates keys from the username and password and securely manages them within the browser—essentially, the same process as key generation in Holochain. Chaperone also handles all zome calls and signing, which means the hApp UI does not have direct access to a user’s login information. Developers using the Holo Hosting web SDK would only interact with Chaperone through the Cross-Origin Message Bus (COMB) library. COMB is our library that wraps the built-in window messenger ( window.postMessage ), making the API more user friendly by adding request/reply, async/await, and other features.",
            "Thus, Holo isn’t responsible for authenticating web users and cannot access keys, minimizing integration requirements and limiting the number of access points that need to be audited for potential leaks. Note: If you were to lose your login information, Holo would not have any way to recover it, so make sure you take steps to prevent that from happening.",
            "If you’re interested in seeing what Chaperone can do, you can use our front end SDK to run a local development instance to test conductors directly without having to connect to a network and a HoloPort. We encourage you to check this out when it’s available for public release."

            "One of the biggest challenges in developing complex hApps with multiple bridges and DNAs has been making sure deployment works—not just now, but in the future. During our early development phases, the pattern was for hApp developers to do a lot of manual tweaking (like using environment variables or npm scripts) to manage things like instance IDs and RPC interface ports. Essentially this amounted to having to manipulate the whole conductor configuration file. The approach often locked devs into one deployment route. For example, if you started developing in a self-contained environment, there wasn’t a straightforward way to switch to Holoscape or Holo Hosting if and when it was required or desired.",
            "This situation came about for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was not until August that we had ‘hApp bundles’, the specifications that define the components of a fully working hApp. They indicate the DNAs and bridges that comprise the back end, as well as an optional, web-based UI package for the front end. The hApp bundle format lets a developer give their own consistent IDs to components without worrying about the user’s existing runtime configuration. This makes hApp deployment a lot more dependable and user friendly.",
            "Secondly, there was no way for devs to use hApp bundles in the development process. We’ve always intended to give them the tools to create runtime-agnostic hApps, which is why we're announcing a new addition to `hc run`. This update will allow you to use hApp bundles during development, and will be included in the next release.",
            "As a kind of manifest for all the parts that will be called upon at runtime, `hc run` will now first look for a `bundle.toml` file in the current working directory. It will then read the file (if present) and configure its internal conductor to implement that hApp bundle—in other words, add all the instances, bridges, and UIs (via its static HTTP server) and run them. Otherwise, it will create an instance of the DNA in the current working directory as before.",
            "With this change, even if you only have one DNA, hApp development should start with writing a hApp bundle. This makes the hApp project future-proof for deployment. The hApp code should make no assumptions about the environment in which it is executed, other than what’s explicitly named in the hApp bundle. Although hApp bundles are not absolutely necessary, they are a must if you roll your own deployment (e.g., put a conductor into an iOS app and manage the UI yourself), want to use the hApp store, or deploy to Holoscape or Holo Hosting."

Even if we entered Open Alpha Testnet with the whole Holochain stack bug-free (we do expect some bugs—that’s why it’s called an alpha), there would still be many hApps, both internal and external, in need of debugging.",
            "Initially, we were planning to have Holochain nodes and HoloPorts send logs and other state information to a central node for diagnostics. Fortunately, sim1h accomplishes this goal while reducing workload. This is due to the fact that it is running as a simulated network in which we can see all the information nodes exchanging, without having to implement special debugging and analytics code. Distributed applications don’t usually let anyone see all the information being exchanged on the network, but it is invaluable for our short-term debugging needs."

By testing and debugging in sim1h we’re gaining confidence that the individual components of our technology stack are working as expected. Holochain Core works well within the boundaries of its tests and in-memory network, as does lib3h within its test suites that try to mock real-world usage. When we put the two together, however, it leads to a lot of complex behaviors that take time to analyze and test.",

This provides huge improvements for us in terms of time-to-delivery and testing capabilities."

In your nix-shell, use the commands dynamodb and dynamodb-memory to start a local instance.",

If these are not set, Rusoto will halt before making a connection, which will be visible in the conductor logs.",

It isn’t connected to AWS credentials and won’t allow any access key to connect to the database. The variables have to be set, however, because Rusoto requires them. The secret key can be arbitrary, but the access key ID should be chosen carefully as different keys will create different spaces. This can be useful since you can have, for example, various IDs for different teams testing the same app in isolation."

After experiencing this progress first hand over the last few weeks we almost immediately began work on the next step which will be even simpler, faster, and closer to the fully peer-to-peer solution in lib3h. The near-term solutions we’ve chosen at the moment—AWS and DynamoDB—both have their own issues when it comes to interacting with Holochain components. For example, each DNA currently has a table in AWS with the DNA’s hash as table name. Because in AWS you have to create tables manually and configure access permissions by table, managing access permissions can be time consuming. Moreover, we’re striving to not rely on databases hosted on AWS, even in test environments. Our goal is to have a centralized node for testing, predominantly based on preexisting Holochain and lib3h code. In the meantime, we think that sim1h will eliminate a lot of the difficulties developers have had while testing their hApps. We hope you agree and would love to hear from you either way."

Holoscape can read and install hApp bundle files. It follows any links inside the bundles to download DNAs and UIs and installs them if they aren’t already. Several hApps can reference the same DNA on which they depend via bridging, but Holoscape will not install the same dependency twice.",

Once you are sure your bundle works, you can send the bundle file to your users through the channel of your choosing. In order to avoid sending several megabytes of DNA and UI binaries, it’s best to upload those files to a location (like a release on your GitHub repository) where they are accessible via a public URL that you can then put into the bundle.",

Even better, these tests will be networking (using sim2h) with the actual internet to connect each machine, giving you higher quality test results and a better picture of how machines running your hApp will function in realistic conditions (e.g., simulating hardware, dog chews through ethernet cable, toddler unplugs HoloPort, etc.)."

In previous versions of Tryorama, the API was set up to take an 'easy’ (sugared) or 'hard' (plain) approach to configuration. One version, with a single required field, was designed for common cases; the other version, which was more verbose, was for special cases where very specific configurations were necessary. This allowed common conductor configurations to be created easily, with as little boilerplate as possible. The problem was that if you departed from the well trodden path in any significant way, you had to switch to ‘hard’ (plain).",

This means that with just a slight increase in boilerplate, you can write test conductor config files without much effort and gradually add more complexity as needed. Unlike earlier versions, you won’t have to make the leap from ‘easy’ to ‘hard’ if you need a greater degree of customization.",

            "As regular readers know, Holo Host Alpha testing has held Holochain to the fire in ways that automated tests never could. We’ve learned about performance bottlenecks, architectural choices that impede debugging, and of course bugs in the code. Very early on in alpha testing, we were forced to consider whether to heavily refactor the current codebase or take our learnings into a complete rewrite.",
            "We’ve decided on the latter, and we’re calling it Holochain RSM (Refactored State Model). In only six months of work the new codebase has surpassed the old one in terms of core features, while improving performance, maintainability, and correctness.",
            "The biggest change, as the name suggests, is the removal of the internal state model inspired by React’s  Redux  pattern. The core dev team found that the extra abstraction layer over the base Holochain state model was making it hard to reason about correctness and hunt down bugs. This became especially plain over the past few months of HoloFuel testing as we identified many ‘holding list discrepancies’, AKA ‘ consistency bugs ’.",
            "Now there’s no extra layer of abstraction between the conductor’s picture of application state and its representation on disk. Not only is this more straightforward (which means existing and future core contributors have less to think about), but it’s more robust in the face of software crashes and power outages. And we’re much more confident that our code correctly implements the  formal specification .",

                "The ‘cascade’, a new caching mechanism, hits local data first,  favouring availability  over freshness. This means that locally written and recently retrieved entries will load instantly without a network call, which is usually the best choice for human-facing applications.",
                "We’ll be using  QUIC  rather than  WebSocket  for node-to-node communication; this will allow busy pairwise connections (such as between DHT neighbours) to  multiplex their transfers  and prevent parallel tasks from blocking each other. QUIC is also  faster over unreliable connections  because  reconnecting takes less time .",
                "We’re  making much better use of  LMDB  to offload things from memory and retrieve data quickly.",
                "Putting all of our changes together, we’re anticipating  up to 2000× performance increases ,  40× less memory usage, 2500× less network chatter, and faster compile times  compared to the previous version of Holochain."

While the QUIC transport part isn’t finished yet (presently instances can only talk to each other within one conductor), it’s already closer to full P2P than the previous version was. That means  sim2h , the centralised switchboard server we’ve been using, goes away completely. (Note: At first all nodes will direct their traffic through a central proxy to reduce the number of variables to debug, but QUIC’s end-to end TLS encryption means the proxy won’t be able to inspect traffic. This wasn’t true of sim2h.)",

At best, it vaguely asserts that scale does not matter and a description for an individual is also a description for a market. But in reality, we see this theory break down in catastrophic ways in an unequal world; it seems that the invisible hand has always had tremors.",
            "My hunch is that the economy has become too large, complex, and dominated by big players for anyone to make truly rational decisions in their own self-interest. How do I make sense of whether my smartphone purchase is going to come back to haunt me and my grandchildren? It’s merely one among  1.5 billion each year ; does it really contribute that much to civil unrest in Africa, pollution in China, and increased CO₂ levels all around the world? But then again, I recognise that “no individual raindrop considers itself responsible for the flood”. In our acceptance of the sole moral guide of economics —  does it benefit me  — it seems we paradoxically end up doing things that are very, very bad for ourselves. And even if we’d like to  excuse  ourselves, we’re often unsure how — life in the global north all but demands that I own one of these stupid smartphones.",
            "Post-Keynesian macroeconomics , a branch of economics that gains insight through accounting equations of an economy as a whole, attempts to correct for the flaws in microeconomic theories of independent individuals by recognising that complex systems are always greater than the sum of their parts. It creates models founded on theories of the entire economic system, populates those models with big aggregate data, and uses the output to inform policies of regional and national governments and international trade.",
            "This is the school of thought that Dr Ussher comes from. But she also acknowledges that there are blind spots in such a theory too: its abstract models and aggregated data sets take a big-picture view, and it doesn’t offer an explanation or prescription for individual behaviour. As such, it doesn’t tell us how we can organise our individual decisions for better global outcomes.",
            "Dr Ussher explains that micro- and macroeconomics both have their place, but they’re taught as separate classes in university and there isn’t really any good way to reconcile the two. It would be great, she says, if there were something that could combine the micro’s individual behaviour approach with the macro’s systems thinking lens. A sort of ‘grand unified model’ for economics.",
            "Then she says something that surprises me: Valueflows, the economic grammar at the heart of hREA, offers a path in this direction. It records the flow of resources between individuals, but it records them from an  independent  view — as a transaction between parties rather than a set of entries in two disconnected ledgers. She claims that this bookkeeping ‘in the open’ is the thing that could align macroeconomic models more closely with the reality of interdependent individuals. And while she acknowledges that this could have serious consequences for privacy and autonomy if done wrong, she’s also thrilled about the immense potential if done right.",
            "At this point, my mind begins to drift back home — could this be useful at the micro level too? If global markets are inefficient because we lack information and power, could Valueflows make more local flows visible, helping us make better decisions in the places where our choices matter? If we could all see unmet needs and unused resources around us, perhaps new businesses would emerge to close those gaps. This would in turn bring the feedback loops between our actions and their consequences closer to home, giving us even more information for wise decision-making.",
            "Dr Ussher’s vision goes beyond mere commerce. With Valueflows, individuals, households, corporates, and governments are not the only agents that make choices and are held accountable; trees, rivers, animals, even the atmosphere could be represented as agents, with rights, duties and decisions via carefully designed smart contracts. As we build an accounting ecosystem of agents, resources and processes with a rich body of shared data, we will be able to see more clearly how our individual — and collective — decisions impact our planet and each other.",
            "With this vision, she  hints  at a much broader concept of the popular term ‘metaverse’. Rather than mere escapism underwritten by advertising money, Valueflows could equip it to become a tool for creating ‘digital twins’ of agents (human and non-human) and resources (artificial and natural, concrete and abstract) and giving them legitimacy in our economics systems.",
            "Given that legal and financial systems are already digital, mapping and controlling our behaviour, she asks whether it’s really such a jump to empower a tree with its own digital presence in an economic metaverse — and endow it with its own agency. This is what excites her most about Valueflows, because it carries the promise of including all entities that we regard as important, holding all participants accountable, and designing features to rebalance inequities in market power, rights, and duties. By giving the biosphere rights, we can internalise externalities. This is nearer than you might think — legal systems are already recognising  bees  and  rivers  in this way.",
            "Recently Dr Ussher was supporting a cohort of students at Simon’s Rock Bard College with exercises involving coordination of student tasks in the campus garden and collecting kitchen waste for composting, or designing a new accounting protocol to reduce Australian deforestation and biodiversity loss.",
            "In these exercises, the goal was to use a Holochain app called  REA Playspace , a canvas that allows them to create models of an economic network. Spread out like this, poorly managed resources (things we might call ‘externalities’) and unserved needs are plainly visible. This can spark spontaneous insights into ways to improve the  circularity  of resource flows, design feedback loops that promote biodiversity, even create business opportunities along the way.",
            "Dr Ussher still plans to use hREA in real on-campus pilot projects. As they progress, she hopes that their reach will quietly, slowly expand to include more local economic activity. Like leaven in the dough, the idea of  deep wealth  could eventually permeate and transform the way we do accounting, and how we hold each other accountable."

          "content": [
            "Laura Sansone is a textile designer and Adjunct Professor of Sustainable Textile Design at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, NY. When she moved to the Hudson Valley, about an hour north of New York City, she became good friends with the orchardist who leased her new property. She saw him selling his produce at a farmer’s market in NYC one weekend, so they got to talking about local food systems. She started to wonder —  why do we care so much about local food systems but barely talk about local textiles?  After all, the local food movement was all about understanding and improving the impact of the way we eat, so why don’t we have a similar relationship with what we wear? Her intimacy with the textile and fashion industry, which  harms us  and our  planet , told her that it could stand to learn a lot from the local food movement.",
            "Sansone came to realise that relocalising clothing production is a good deal more challenging; there are a lot more people between a sheep and your sweater than there are between a tomato plant and tonight’s dinner. As a textile designer, she found herself at the very end of a network of producers, processors, and distributors who had already made their own decisions about what materials she could work with.",
            "So she put herself at the front of the supply chain.  As a designer, she reasoned, she would have the power to make impactful choices if she could be involved in the whole process. Starting small, she aggregated wool from several small local farmers, transported it in a borrowed pickup truck, and brought it to the few remaining wool processing facilities in the New York bioregion — one of which was just a farmer with a handful of washing machines in her garage to wash the animal fibers.",
            "This wasn’t meant to turn into a business; it was just supposed to prove that Sansone’s idea for a local textile economy could work. However, she soon found herself selling her yarn to other designers, and eventually creating a line of  finished products  for sale.",
            "Now, at the centre of  NY Textile Lab , a small but growing collaborative network of producers, processors, and designers, she and her partner Evan Schwartz need something more than an address book and a pile of spreadsheets.",
            "Sansone and Schwartz were attracted to hREA because it’s expressive enough to model the complexity of the rich web of relationships they’re weaving. They intend to record details about the raw materials and the processes they went through, such as transport miles and climate-beneficial verifications, so customers can see exactly what went into their garments. They also want individual designers to be able to merge their buying power, simplifying procurement and reducing costs for everyone.",
            "With this complexity comes a lot of administration, so they’re looking forward to using hREA to automate most of that. As a generic toolkit that uses a simple ontology for building all sorts of economic applications, it can be used for bookkeeping, inventory, supply chain management, certification tracking, enterprise resource planning, alternative currencies, and even sharing of production process recipes.",
            "Listening to Schwartz explain their vision, I wonder what the value proposition is for designers. It sounds like they might struggle to understand why they would want to be more transparent, choosing to give up the competitive edge that  supply chain trade secrets  give them. He answers my concerns before I even voice them: This isn’t meant for the Ralph Laurens and Patagonias out there. They already have their supply chains in place, and they’re already working to answer customers’ demand for more visibly ethical sourcing.",
            "This is meant for small designers and light industry, in order to grow a more horizontal economic model — the recent design school grad who’s starting her brand with a production run of only 20 sweaters, the small farmer only raising a few dozen animals, the ‘mini mill’ that is currently serving ‘handcrafters’. These people currently don’t have the power to compete in the same way; the landscape of potential suppliers is challenging to navigate, and as individuals they don’t have the ability to meet minimum order quantities, nor the purchasing power to make their production economical. The patterns Sansone and Schwartz are building are giving these smaller designers the ability to enter the market — as well as giving sustainable livelihoods to local farmers and regional processors.",
            "Listening more deeply, I realise that they’re actually building an open-source economic model for the textile industry — and local markets in general. In the logic of this economy, everyone succeeds when supply chain relationships and other intellectual property are shared. And Sansone and Schwartz plan to share their templates as they evolve, enabling other local production economies to spring up across the world.",
            "And more than that — they’re building an economy that functions ecologically. Ecosystems don’t usually create chains, because chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Instead, ecosystems create  webs  — complex patterns of relationship with multiple interdependencies and redundancies. Schwartz claims that this is the way to build supply systems that are resilient in the face of disruptions. And  goodness knows  we could use a bit more of that."

          "content": [
            "NY Textile Lab isn’t the only one building an economy that understands the ecosystem it belongs to. For the last eleven years  Sensorica , producers of electronic hardware, has been operating as what’s known as an  open value network , or OVN. Rather than a hierarchically organised company, an OVN is a decentralised network of economic agents, each of them free to do their own thing but linked to each other by collaborative relationships.",
            "Tiberius Brastaviceanu, the co-founder of Sensorica, tells me that they borrow ideas from self-organising systems such as insect colonies. Most importantly, their network operates on a few simple rules that produce complex — and ultimately meaningful — behaviour.",
            "The first rule is this: you can do whatever you like, but whatever you do,  make it  visible .  Announce it and document it. If you’ve got a 3D printer, make it available. If you’ve come up with a design for a more efficient  heat recovery ventilator , share the source files along with your research process. That lets others build on your offerings and increase the total value in the system.",
            "Biologists who study insect colonies came up with a word for this:  stigmergy , or ‘leaving signals in your environment for others to act on’. This appears to be the chief principle that makes self-organising systems work. Although it may seem chaotic, the end result is not. I mean, just look at what these bees created without a boss. (It’s actually a  myth  that the queen is in charge.)",
            "Brastaviceanu echoes Dr Ussher’s concerns about the privacy and autonomy issues that crop up when we aggregate so much of our data like this. But he believes that Holochain resists this risk by embedding an ethos of ‘data commons’ — a democratisation of knowledge, through a  peer-to-peer database , that prevents big players from  capturing  that knowledge and controlling access to it.",
            "There are other rules that draw inspiration from nature, such as the  right to raise a red flag  if you see someone doing or proposing something that could harm the network.",
            "But one rule comes directly from traditional economics. All relationships are underwritten by something called a  benefit redistribution algorithm , an agreement that defines how benefits will be distributed in a venture. For example, when your product is exchanged for money, the proceeds get distributed, not just to you but also to the equipment operators, designers, and parts suppliers in the OVN that sit upstream of the product. Before that point, all those contributors are shareholders; after that point, they all get their dividends. You can think of it like a  stock , but for an individual sale rather than an entire company.",
            "You’d be justified in thinking that this sounds like a lot of data to keep track of. That’s why Sensorica is a key supporter of hREA, which was explicitly designed to keep track of complex agreements and resource flows involving multiple forms of resources.",
            "In fact, Brastaviceanu explains that the design of Valueflows is based directly on learnings from the first version of their software, called Network Resource Planning or NRP. Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen of Mikorizal Software  created  it from scratch, because traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting software focuses on a single company, not a network of actors. Now Foster and Haugen are stewarding the creation of an ecosystem of Valueflows-based tools, many (though  not all ) of which are built on hREA.",
            "Because it uses Holochain, hREA is doing to NRP’s software architecture what NRP did to ERP’s economic assumptions: it breaks down barriers and connects actors together. There is no server in a Holochain app; each user simply connects to other users’ machines to share data and make transactions. And when two networks want to start interacting with each other — as in the case of Sensorica collaborating with a copywriting community in Brazil — the barrier is low, because each participant has full access to the data in the spaces they belong to. This lays the foundation for highly interoperable applications.",
            "Brastaviceanu tells me that one of the things about Holochain that excites him the most is the capacity for groups to create their own applications by connecting smaller components into a greater whole. This is exemplified by a  groupware application ‘container’  called  We , which already has a few simple  components  and expects to add many more (including ones for hREA and  reputation intelligence ) in the future.",
            "Brastaviceanu believes that cooperative producer networks will only succeed in the global marketplace if they have the tools to capitalise on and grow their ‘collaborative advantage’. He sees open-source software like hREA and  We  as critical tools to help make that dream become reality."

The fact is, we all end up better when we choose to work together. I know that sounds like something you learned in kindergarten. But it seems we unlearn this as we grow up, and it's time to relearn it.",
            "These three projects, along with a handful of others in places like Sweden and Colombia, are courageously building economic experiments based on what they learned in kindergarten, and it’s working. And hREA, having reached its first  major milestone release , is getting prepared to power the economic intelligence behind all of these projects. It's working and ready for developers to hack on, as seen in this  demo video.",

REA provides one possible solution to the problem of interpreting and transmitting value between separate (yet interconnected) networks of people, by providing a common language to describe different types of resources that can be understood and acted upon by those further afield. Having the ‘realtime’ (signaling) affordances of Holochain, but also the offline-friendly affordances of eventual consistency, are both crucial to forming resilient economic networks. The always-on availability of data during network growth thanks to the self-healing / dynamic DHT is another important affordance."

Instead of providing just a barebones set of APIs as “Zome calls” (the native Holochain hApp API layer over websockets) hREA implements an abstraction over that layer and wraps it in a client-side GraphQL Client, that matches the ValueFlows GraphQL specification. This means that developers familiar (or not!) with GraphQL can use their skills or the excellent GraphQL documentation resources to access Holochain without yet knowing all the ins and outs of Holochain. Basically, hREA implements a really generic hApp that many different developers can download and plug in, and start developing their own custom user interface with. This prevents developers from having to learn the Rust language to work with Holochain, for many use cases, so the doors are open to a much wider audience!"

The hREA team is pleased with the improvement of separation between the so-called ‘integrity’ and ‘coordination’ zomes, as it makes for a better user experience for the hREA end users, who will not need to face complex data migrations as regularly, during software updates. hREA has a large set of integration tests built with the Tryorama test suite provided by Holochain, where it has over 600 assertions!

It is perhaps the most critical component in building out the HoloFuel ecosystem within the larger Holo ecosystem. Making sure the transactor works properly, particularly when it comes to payments and hosting, is a priority for us as we progress through the Alpha Testnet.",
            "The HoloFuel transactor is the hApp for sending and receiving HoloFuel, and similar in many respects to a Bitcoin wallet. We’ve already shown you what the UI will look like from the user’s perspective, but it’s important to remember that the UI acts as a bridge to the HoloFuel transactor, which is where the actual process of moving HoloFuel to various destinations takes place. We therefore want you to see the underlying product functions and what makes our approach to HoloFuel different from other digital currencies.",
            "The key element that distinguishes the HoloFuel transactor from others is its agent-centric design. In other words, it is up to both the sender and receiver of HoloFuel to sign transactions confirming them. This marks a difference from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar currencies, where only the sender signs the transaction. This simple distinction creates a more accountable experience, yet intuitive and forgiving, experience.",

You therefore have a window in which you can cancel the transaction if you accidentally send someone fundsor find suspicious activity on your counterparty’s source chain. Already, you can see an advantage over blockchain-based currencies, in which transactions—even accidental or fraudulent ones—are irrevocable once sent. This pending state also helps eliminate the frustrating cryptocurrency problem of sending HoloFuel to the wrong address."

Like hApp developers, hosts are active participants in the HoloFuel ecosystem and are able to not only send, but issue requests for payment. Again, with our agent-centric approach, if the agent who is being asked to send funds declines to do so, they can reject the request. This gives HoloFuel a user experience on par with modern consumer payment apps like Venmo, PayPal, or WeChat—as well as a smaller learning curve than other digital currencies.",
            "In addition, the request function can be integrated with logging hApps to handle invoicing. This makes it much simpler to build an e-commerce operation fully within Holochain without the need for third-party invoicing or other data collection/storage services—it can be done simply by integrating HoloFuel."

We were seeing an unusual performance curve, where earlier transactions would resolve very quickly but resolution time would climb as more people joined and sent Test Fuel to each other. The core team isolated the problem to a certain asynchronous part of the code, where background tasks were being continually checked to see if they’d resolved yet. For tasks that took a long time to resolve, this consumed a lot of unnecessary CPU time. If you’re curious about the details, you can read about it in the  pull request .",

In fact, HoloFuel has become a great way for us to test Holochain, because it’s a fairly sophisticated hApp. If there are performance issues, mistakes in validation workflows, or bugs in the consistency model, HoloFuel is likely to uncover them. In addition to the work we’ve already shared, the core team is carefully refactoring certain parts of Holochain’s core to reflect things we’ve learned in the HoloFuel journey. This work will make it easier to reason about, debug, and guarantee the correctness of core workflows.",
            "But HoloFuel itself is also seeing some changes. There are lots of  different   ways  to model a mutual credit currency in code, and some are more appropriate than others depending on your context. Do you want credit limits, or will an  Open Money or LETS-style currency  work better for your community? Do you prefer fast finality or rigorous finality? Do you want to optimise for always-online users, or should it be partition-tolerant? There is no right answer for all use cases.",
            "HoloFuel’s codebase initially had a very clever five-step process. This was optimal for asynchronous communication between users who connected and disconnected from the DHT regularly.",
            "The primary use case for HoloFuel is quick-resolving, high-volume, low-value microtransactions between always-on HoloPorts and hApp publishers. This means that, while the current design was robust, it added a lot of validation overhead for little pragmatic benefit.

Linking all entries of a certain type to an anchor recreates some of the functionality you’re used to in traditional databases, such as tables and views. Here’s one example: each wiki page  has its own anchor  that acts as its consistent unique identity across content updates (remember, each  update to an entry  gives it a new ID, so it’s often good to create something more stable to ‘anchor’ it to).",

            "In the DNA JSON file you can include  ‘properties’ —arbitrary key/value pairs that you can use in your zome code to do anything you like. With the Progenitor pattern, you add a ‘progenitor’ property with the public key of a certain privileged agent. Your zome code then checks this property whenever it needs to know if an agent is allowed to publish an entry to the DHT. Here’s how the roles mixin  finds the progenitor’s key :",
            "At the start, the progenitor has one built-in role: the  admin  role, which can  never be taken away  from them. This gives them the power to create role assignment entries for others. Those entries’ validation function  checks whether the author has the admin role . If they don’t, validation fails and the DHT rejects the role assignment. In that way, only the progenitor and the agents they set up as admins can create and assign roles to other agents.",

Through an unbroken run of 63 weeks, the team responsible for Dev Pulse created the first regular, dependable voice for our organization and the things happening inside it. Though we’ve heard how much you’ve missed this institution of all things Holochain and Holo dev, we hope that some of the exciting updates below will help make it all feel worth it. We’re especially thrilled to report Holochain is now fast enough to support 5000 nodes operating simultaneously in one hApp. This feels like a harbinger of more to come. In the very near term we want to give a shout to all of our incredible community organizers who are rapidly growing an ecosystem of next-level Holochain devs. You’re truly doing great things."

            "As you may have heard, over the past several weeks we’ve been in the process of a significant  organizational reset . While part of this reset involves aligning expenses with budget, it goes deeper than that. We’re aligning the entire organization around a recommitment to agile practices, and delivering real, immediate needs to our dev community and customers at all times. In the last weeks we’ve begun synchronizing our planning cycles across development, communications, marketing, customer support, and developer support. At the beginning of each cycle, our intention is to listen deeply to both internal and external voices as we ask each other: “what’s the next most important thing we can work on?” Though we’ve always been in a continual process of learning and improving how we work together, we believe this latest iteration will markedly upgrade the full product loop from inside our team, out to you, and then back again to our team. We aren’t finished with these latest changes to the ways we work, but the development teams are already enjoying big improvements as they unify their to-do lists, dev cycles, and planning meetings.",
            "Why should this matter for you, dear reader? If you’re an application developer, project founder, community organizer, or open-source contributor you’ll feel this directly. You’ll be pleased to know that your voice will be present at the table, right beside our internal teams, HoloPort owners, and HOT hodl-ers. We’ve created a new team, Service Operations, whose job is to deeply listen and champion the needs of every one of you. We’re not just improving integration between teams; we’re setting an intention to become more responsive to the whole community. Ultimately we want to remove blockers to your success, because when you win, everybody wins.",
            "We don’t yet know exactly how this will look or how many iterations it’ll take. And we know that we need to carefully balance between sometimes competing needs. And because we’re humans, making software, that is running on hardware in a world with real financial constraints, it is by nature a complex decision matrix. So depending on  your  perspective and needs it might sometimes feel like we’re giving more attention to this chunk of software or that piece of the network. But the reality is we need to deliver on all of our promises to a diverse group of stakeholders for us to succeed in our long-term vision. Through that process we want to share that we’re committed to supporting the needs of every stakeholder, not just a few. The highlights below hint a little about what this means. We’ll continue to share more as we work on things like a responsive, iterative roadmap and regular calls for input from devs, community leaders, and hosts in the ecosystem."

This is just what we need to make sure Holochain is ready for real hApps, including the first ones to be deployed on the Holo host network. Make sure you learn about how to use Tryorama and TryCP to test your own hApps—start by reading the  introduction  and following the  tutorials .",
            "But we haven’t completely stopped new development. We’ve released  version 0.0.7 of Holoscape , with bug fixes and conductor binaries updated to 0.0.42-alpha5. (Take note of a  breaking change  that will require you to edit any existing conductor config file.) And you can look forward to  pagination  and  sorting  of links queries in a future release, along with a  new WebAssembly engine  that massively improves DNA performance and shrinks DNA package size. This new engine also fixes several critical memory bugs (e.g. now you can allocate up to 4gb of memory for arguments to wasm functions whereas the old limit was closer to 640kb) and it is generally simpler to understand."

Every week, we get excited about the impending update, get a release announcement ready… and discover another blocker or two. Why is this taking so long, you might ask?",
            "Many of us in the org are software development veterans. Our developers and project leads have been chosen for their wealth of wisdom, gained from years of working with large and small software projects. Many of these projects were quite demanding. Even with all this experience, it turns out that building Holochain is more complex than, and simply  different  from, what we’ve faced before. And rightly so, because we’re building something that tackles problems in new ways. We’re not newbies, but we regularly feel like we are.",
            "In sharing the specifics of what’s blocking a HoloFuel release, we hope that you’ll learn from our experience and use it as a guide in your own hApp testing process. By choosing Holochain, you’re putting your faith in something quite unique, which comes with risks. We acknowledge that, and we’re grateful for your boldness. Even with a rich body of literature on eventual consistency, distributed systems, and cryptographic data structures, you’ll likely be facing design problems that nobody else has faced. So as we learn the best ways of developing and testing hApps, we want to make sure that our learnings bear fruit beyond our teams.",
            "In recent internal tests, HoloFuel would work great for the first day, then performance would slow down. Existing participants would try to verify a transaction by contacting its authors, then timeout and get stuck in a holding pattern. Investigation showed that it was due to the behaviour of HoloPortOS after an upgrade: the HoloPort owner’s source chain would get cleared, but their key would remain the same. Often, the upgrade only contained UI fixes, which meant that the HoloFuel DNA hash (and hence the DHT) persisted between updates. This would cause the user to create a new source chain with the same ID.",
            "If you know about Holochain’s data integrity, you know that this  breaks the rule  that says an agent’s  source chain  must not branch, because that would create alternate histories and ruin the integrity of the system. But because the HoloPort simply forgot its old source chain, it created awkward situations like:",
            "These unresolvable conversations eventually ground activity to a halt. We fixed Holochain so that validation would fail if the author’s node can’t produce a validation package. But suddenly, Holochain did what it was supposed to, and marked nearly everyone’s data as invalid.",
            "So we decided to start each testing cycle in a fresh DHT without any history. The simplest way to do this is to change the DNA package so that its hash is different. And the simplest way to do  that  is to change its UUID field, either in the project’s app.json file or the conductor config. We’re currently working on a way to automate the clean-slate DHT policy to make testing cycles faster.",
            "We’re also working on a fix to HoloPortOS that keeps source chains between updates, which will prevent the source chain conflicts in the first place. This will of course be necessary for live hApps.",
            "Even though this has to do with our work fixing bugs in Holochain or HoloPortOS, we still think that the clean-slate DHT technique could be of use to hApp developers. Here are reasons you might want to create a new DNA hash with every testing cycle:",

                "Sometimes we might release a Holochain update that fixes outstanding validation bugs, at which point you’ll likely want to bump the DNA hash in both testing and live environments to clean up invalid data."

            "One of the biggest challenges in developing complex hApps with multiple bridges and DNAs has been making sure deployment works—not just now, but in the future. During our early development phases, the pattern was for hApp developers to do a lot of manual tweaking (like using environment variables or npm scripts) to manage things like instance IDs and RPC interface ports. Essentially this amounted to having to manipulate the whole conductor configuration file. The approach often locked devs into one deployment route. For example, if you started developing in a self-contained environment, there wasn’t a straightforward way to switch to Holoscape or Holo Hosting if and when it was required or desired.",
            "This situation came about for a couple of reasons. First of all, it was not until August that we had ‘hApp bundles’, the specifications that define the components of a fully working hApp. They indicate the DNAs and bridges that comprise the back end, as well as an optional, web-based UI package for the front end. The hApp bundle format lets a developer give their own consistent IDs to components without worrying about the user’s existing runtime configuration. This makes hApp deployment a lot more dependable and user friendly.",
            "Secondly, there was no way for devs to use hApp bundles in the development process. We’ve always intended to give them the tools to create runtime-agnostic hApps, which is why we're announcing a new addition to `hc run`. This update will allow you to use hApp bundles during development, and will be included in the next release.",
            "As a kind of manifest for all the parts that will be called upon at runtime, `hc run` will now first look for a `bundle.toml` file in the current working directory. It will then read the file (if present) and configure its internal conductor to implement that hApp bundle—in other words, add all the instances, bridges, and UIs (via its static HTTP server) and run them. Otherwise, it will create an instance of the DNA in the current working directory as before.",
            "With this change, even if you only have one DNA, hApp development should start with writing a hApp bundle. This makes the hApp project future-proof for deployment. The hApp code should make no assumptions about the environment in which it is executed, other than what’s explicitly named in the hApp bundle. Although hApp bundles are not absolutely necessary, they are a must if you roll your own deployment (e.g., put a conductor into an iOS app and manage the UI yourself), want to use the hApp store, or deploy to Holoscape or Holo Hosting."

This customized build is necessary because it routes users’ data requests to the Holochain engine and secures access to this data via many different services, each of which are in constant development.

We’ve set it up so that each element of HoloPortOS is pinned inside the file. Every time this file is changed, it triggers an automated build process. During this process, the system runs a set of tests specific to the updated element, as well as a set of integration tests for the entire OS.",

In that post we also described how this approach of mocking the network with a centralized component provides us with an evolution path of iteratively pulling in aspects of lib3h as they’re ready -- instead of trying to conquer all of the inherent complexity in a single iteration.",

            "In other words, sim2h marks the first point in time, since we abandoned the Go prototype, at which anyone (developers and non-developers)  can run alpha test releases of hApps over the public internet!"

          "content": [
            "There is one thing that sim1h and sim2h have in common: both rely on a central point connecting the agents -- but that is about it.",
            "While sim1h is very similar to contemporary centralized front-end / back-end architecture in that it uses a database as the central component,  sim2h does not rely on any centralized data persistence!  Instead it plays a role similar to these old telephone switch-boards where an operator takes a request of a network participant and sets up the appropriate connection to another participant (without storing or controlling what those participants say on that line).",
            "Interestingly, this actually reduces complexity compared to the sim1h solution where the network had to be simulated inside a database which meant actually storing messages and then polling for messages on the other end. The concept of a switch-board, which maintains active websocket connections to each agent that is online, works much better with all the assumptions that have been made in other parts of the Holochain stack -- mainly Holochain core, as well as lib3h. In fact, that central component of sim2h borrows a lot from already existing pieces and in essence is like the in-memory network that we’ve used in core for local testing of multiple instances (i.e. mocking the network in-memory). In other words, Sim2h uses the websocket implementation from lib3h to create encrypted “wormholes” between each Holochain conductor instance and this central “in-memory” switch-board.",
            "The result is that we have a single point to route all Holochain network messages to their according recipient.",

                "Holochain’s overlay-network (where each agent is addressed with its agent_id, i.e. its public key) is the topology that core instances see and use to talk to each other",
                "It is not possible to impersonate an agent/user without access to their keys and source chain and neither are stored at the central component. (That means the principles of our  Cryptographic Autonomy License  still apply despite the centralized nature of sim2h.)"
              ]
            },
            "Note that the above bullet points are  not  true for sim1h, as messages (as well as entry data) is stored in the centralized database and that’s what nodes rely on. Getting rid of that database both gets us much closer to the network structure that Holochain is built for and also has avery important pragmatic benefit:  the central component doesn’t need to be protected the way a database would need to as it doesn’t manage any persistent state .",
            "The database sim1h uses can’t just be made available publicly on the internet -- even for testing purposes -- without asking for trouble. Sim2h on the other side just facilitates connections between nodes of the same DNA. The state of the DHT is stored exclusively in all the nodes at the edges. Any change has to pass through the DNAs validation rules the same way it would in a fully peer-to-peer setting.",
            "This difference is precisely what enables us to use sim2h right now for our first public Holochain test network. This is also an important prerequisite for Holo’s first test network.",
            "That said, the fact that all messages are routed through a single point creates a single point of failure, which surely is not what you would want for a production ready p2p framework. But it actually is very beneficial for test networks, as already described  in the post about sim1h . That’s because, in all alpha test networks, and potentially in early betas, we definitely want to be able to log network messages as needed in order to gain a global view for debugging. So we believe the single point of failure is a reasonable trade-off (during alpha and early beta phases) for the ability to analyse the network. And should that central point actually experience issues, we can spawn new machines without even managing any application data, since that is stored at the node level."

This DNA specific setting is using DNA properties to include the sim2h server URL within the DNA. Since the latest Holochain release v0.0.36-alpha1 (included in Holoscape v0.0.3) there is a special DNA property name “sim2h_url” that, if set, overrides the conductor wide sim2h_url configuration variable with the value of this property.",

Sim2h does this by asking other nodes what they hold, keeping an in-memory cache of all addresses of all entries in the network that is has seen and then comparing the holding and authoring lists of nodes. What this means is that currently sim2h orchestrates the network to have a full copy of all the entry data at each node - i.e. a full-sync or  mirror  DHT.",
            "Unfortunately, since each DNA agent requires a separate sim2h websocket connection, each server is theoretically limited (by centralized server port constraints) to communicating with about 65,000 agents. Our next steps are related to overcoming this limitation.",
            "The next step that is  already being worked on , is to pull in more lib3h code and implement rrDHT style sharding with sim2h. This is a good example of the benefit that this approach gives us: we can test out high-level assumptions and algorithms just by changing the gossip logic within the sim2h server, which has all the needed information within its local transient memory. It is much easier to iterate on different aspects of the networking implementation and get each aspect (like the sharding algorithms) right, before jumping to a fully decentralized network which is just much harder to analyse.",
            "I want to close by expressing my personal excitement about the fact that with sim2h we don’t have to wait any longer until all aspects of lib3h are proven out and ready to be used as a whole. Instead, we can shift into a much more agile pattern and work more closely together with the community of hApp developers, since now (after more than a year of waiting for the “Rust refactor”) we have a fully working Holochain stack again.",

We pitched a Visa Issuance system using blockchain and won the Nikkei  Newspaper Special Award. I became friends with the Philippine blockchain-based project (Loyalcoin) team and joined several of their meetups, including their blockchain conferences in Cebu. That’s how my interest in decentralized technologies built up.",

            "A prominent example is the one-sided commercialization of personal information at a major video rental store. The reason for this being a problem was that the sales were made by selling personal information such as the videos you rent, where you used your points and what you bought with it. They sold to an undisclosed third party, whose purpose was completely different from the initial reason stated for collecting personal information when the users agreed to their terms. In February 2017, the Cabinet Secretariat IT General Strategy Office's Data Distribution Environment Improvement Study Group came up with a statement in which they said that in order to achieve a smooth distribution of large amounts of varied data, they need a system that promotes data distribution and utilization with the involvement of individuals (information banks, etc.). Currently, a legal system that considers the regulations of giant IT companies is being developed in Japan. According to a major newspaper, \"The government will develop legislation with a view to regulate huge IT companies from the perspective of protecting personal information by 2020.\" The government wants to have a similar legislature like the GDPR because it regards the protection of personal information as a national matter.",

Going back in time, Ethernet and the Internet removed the inconvenience of the mainframe computer era, but in exchange exposed external attacks such as those we are experiencing today. The Internet was originally open and was envisioned as a platform where anyone could freely share ideas and opportunities across borders. However, this is not the case now. A few large companies are hosting our personal data under the disguise of “free service” and commercialize our personal identities without our knowledge or consent. In hindsight, it feels like Holo and Holochain are trying to realize the original vision of the Internet. I think this is the reason why so many expectations have gathered around the future of hApps (Holochain applications) and Holochain technology."

At first the team chose an approach using links. “Arthur soon advised us to use anchors to ensure scalability and create a more elegant code base”, explains Eduardo. Anchors assist in finding targeted data by having predictable or discoverable bases to get_links from.",

In 2015 he co-hosted the first blockchain meetup in Melbourne, and spent months planning the business of a crypto hedge fund in 2017.  Mike was on the advisory board for the 2018 APAC Blockchain conference.  In 2018 he began investigating Holochain and brought the concepts to startup RedGrid.  RedGrid is addressing demand management on the national grid to prevent blackouts and decentralize energy.  A profound characteristic of Holochain is it is 'agent-centric'; RedGrid has fully embraced biomimicry to guide design and find we are talking with molecular biologists and immunologists, people far outside our path of traditional software development.  Mike runs the Melbourne Holochain meetups.

            "Over 2018 I became sold on the technology and brought it to RedGrid.  A key decider in my mind was the local presence of Phil Beadle, David Meister, and Willem Olding; this level of expertise was not available to us with blockchain offerings and I knew this was a huge intangible benefit.   As I looked further, I found the deeper undercurrent of ethical systems.  A big moment for me was watching Matthew Schutte’s video in Amsterdam in September; I felt I could get behind this movement.   The Intensive gathering in Queensland, Australia in March 2019 can only be described as “historic” (I have used that word a lot this past year).",
            "Along the way we have had some champion help, certainly through Art and the Commons Engine, but also closer to home with people like Courtney Blackman who runs YBF Ventures, the co-working centre that houses RedGrid’s office.  She allowed us to use the magnificent ballroom at YBF free of charge, and she will extend the offer into 2020.   Another has been Damon Gameau, the creator of the 2040 film (plug: go see it!  Take your children!).   At a recent conference I said, “There is a blockchain industry, but a Holochain community”.  I realised I had tapped into a group that cared, was trying to fix things, and might just do it.  It is the same attitude we have at RedGrid; we are on a true mission.   Personally, I am drawing from many aspects of my past that I thought I would never revisit, such as Benoit Mandelbrot’s “Fractal Geometry of Nature”.   It is all coming together for me now; now is the time."

            "For the past few months, we’ve been working toward a mature testing framework that allows developers to test their conductors in real world situations and under a variety of conditions. Our first breakthrough was  Diorama , an application that helped us move away from Node.JS-based conductors in favor of Rust-based conductors. Diorama allowed for simple tests between Holochain instances running on a single conductor. It was intended primarily for third-party Holochain developers to test their zome logic in multi-node scenarios using in-memory networking.When the Holochain Core Dev Team needed to write its own end-to-end tests, they turned to Diorama. However, Diorama could only handle a single conductor, which meant they couldn’t get a good picture of how the networking code was actually running.",
            "This new tool was dubbed  Try-o-rama  — the logic being that Diorama incremented would be Triorama, but Try-o-rama sounded catchier! The initial version, 0.0.0, was used to implement Holochain Core’s app-spec tests and functioned as an end-to-end test suite enabling full Holochain functionality in multi-node scenarios.",
            "A new problem emerged — we now had two testing tools, Diorama and Try-o-rama, both of which had their own limitations and peculiarities. Which tool should be used in a given situation? There has been some confusion in the dev community, even within internal Holochain teams, about how to proceed. A single tool for all conditions would be highly preferable and would help to consolidate the gains we have made in our testing framework."

            "Most significantly, Try-o-rama can now not only specify multiple conductors for a test, but also arbitrarily start and stop conductor processes during a test. As our lib3h networking module is coming into fruition, we can write a whole new class of tests to ensure that networking is robust in realistic situations where nodes are constantly joining and leaving networks.",

But not only that — you can now use  external hashes  as well! Hashes now come in one extra flavour,  AnyLinkable , and all link manipulation functions now expect a new type called  AnyLinkableHash , which can be converted from an  entry ,  header , or  external  hash (note: the DNA hash is still not linkable, by design).

It moves all the features needed for deterministic integrity into two new crates —  holochain_integrity_types  for the types and   holochain_deterministic_integrity  for the host functions ( #1305 ,  #1324 ). (In the process, the HDK no longer depends on rusqlite!)  At this point, you don’t need to do any code edits , as these crates get imported into the HDK for you. But your zomes will  need to be recompiled  in order to be compatible with this week’s Holochain release.",

It was especially ambitious because, at the time, we didn’t have a functioning network stack.",
            "Now it’s the new year, and as you know we  hit that target  almost a month ago. Shortly afterwards, a regression was introduced that capped that at 1500 nodes in high-load situations, but after fixing that bug, we are now  up to 7500 nodes !"

To be ready for alpha testing, a functional Holochain runtime should be able to support app networks consisting of all HoloPort owners and a generous number of native Holochain users with a realistic level of activity.",
            "What does this mean in real terms? The ideal we’re shooting for is that the experience of using a Holochain app should be equal to or better than a traditional cloud app, while delivering all the advantages of a decentralised peer-to-peer network. Blockchain’s scalability is limited by intentional architectural choices, while Holochain is designed to scale with the number of users. Everyone brings their own processing power, plus a bit extra to keep the network alive. This means that, in theory, a Holochain app can scale infinitely to meet the needs of real humans—humans who want their apps to be nimble and responsive, so they can get on with their lives. Our goal is to prove that it’s true in practice.",
            "The most important metric for quality of user experience is  latency , or “why is this thing taking so long?” So in order to deliver on our goal to create a usable framework for P2P apps, we needed to prove that Holochain could stay responsive in realistic situations.",
            "Using the  Tryorama testing framework , we designed a test to answer the question, “can a network quickly reach consistency if 5000 people try to join all at once?” While this might not be a common occurrence, it does make a good baseline for measuring how Holochain handles a highly stressful situation. We reason that, if it can handle this, it should be quite capable of handling more typical situations.",

As mentioned before, our stress-testing infrastructure is capable of testing any app that has a few Tryorama tests written against it. Our current focus is basic Holochain functionality (joining a network, publishing data, retrieving data, direct messages) under basic scenarios (always online, disconnect and reconnect, crashed conductor, etc). We’re also testing HoloFuel as part of our ‘final exam’ test plan that determines Holochain’s readiness for the Holo host Alpha testing."

            "When we fired up real networking for the first time, we found that it was difficult to reason about the interactions of an unbounded number of independent machines in an unreliable network such as the internet. After all the big bugs were out of the way, some data was still getting stuck, and we were having a hard time getting Holochain to scale past 10 nodes. We needed a global view of traffic, so we could identify exactly what was getting stuck, and where, and then form theories about why.",
            "So we introduced  sim1h , a P2P network simulator that held the entire DHT in a central database. That was replaced with  sim2h , which handles gossip routing centrally but lets agent nodes hold shards of the DHT. These two tools let us identify the causes of a number of tricky problems that prevented the network from reaching consistency.",
            "After the consistency issues were resolved, we saw rapid gains in performance as we identified and removed bottlenecks. Many of these were related to  multithreading , so we’ve put a lot of attention on making Holochain use threads more efficiently. As we tackled these hot spots, we went from 10, to 100, to 1000, to 5000, to 7500 nodes fairly quickly.",
            "Our plan is to incrementally replace pieces of sim2h with decentralised pieces from  lib3h  (our fully P2P networking solution) as they are built and proven to work. Eventually there will be very little of sim2h left at all, except perhaps as a proxy for those who are behind restrictive firewalls. But you’ll still be able to use it in your own test simulations."
